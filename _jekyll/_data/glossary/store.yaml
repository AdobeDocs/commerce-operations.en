definition: |
  The Commerce scope level of "store" is the second level of your website's hierarchy, which goes as follows: website > store > store view.
  Stores can be organized into one or many. Each store, potentially, has its own root category, and all share catalog and customer data.

  Each store can have multiple store views, which are typically used to present the storefront in a different locale and language.
