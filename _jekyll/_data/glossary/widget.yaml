  A [widget](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/content-design/elements/widgets/widgets.html) is a prepared snippet of code that can be used to place blocks, links, and dynamic content at specific locations on store pages.
  You can use widgets to create landing pages for marketing campaigns, display promotional content at specific locations throughout the store.
  Widgets can also be used to add interactive elements and action blocks for external review systems, video chats, voting, and subscription forms, or to provide navigation elements for tag clouds and image sliders.
