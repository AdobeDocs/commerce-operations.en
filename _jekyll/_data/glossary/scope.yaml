  In Adobe Commerce, scope describes the extent of your store hierarchy that a setting can affect.
  Scope can apply to the following:

  * Global — all websites, stores, and store views
  * Website — the selected website and all stores and store views under it
  * Store — the selected store and all store views under it
  * Store View — the selected store view.

  Within the hierarchy, settings applied at a lower level can override some higher-level settings.
