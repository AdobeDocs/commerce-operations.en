  Virtual types are a way to inject different dependencies into existing PHP classes without affecting other classes and without having to create a class file.
  Virtual types can only be referenced by argument overrides in a `<type>` element within di.xml files, never in source code.
  They can't be extended and they can't be references as dependencies in a classes constructor.
