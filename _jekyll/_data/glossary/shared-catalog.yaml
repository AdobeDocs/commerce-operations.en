definition: |
  A feature that allows merchants to create a catalog that can serve as their entire catalog or a subset of it, and then assign custom prices for one or more products.
  Merchants can then assign this catalog to one or more companies.

  For example, a B2B merchant has three customers who have negotiated specific rates for the merchant's electronics distribution site.
  Using the shared catalog feature, the merchant has:

  * A main catalog
  * A customer 1 catalog (perhaps it is just three SKUs with heavy discounts on them from the main catalog)
  * Customer 2 catalog (could be the entire catalog with 10% off)
  * Customer 3 catalog (a few dozen products with discounts off the main catalog ranging from 5% - 60%).
