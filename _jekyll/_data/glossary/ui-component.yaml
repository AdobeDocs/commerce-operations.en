  A tag designed for Magento 2 software to enable simpler and more flexible user interface (UI) rendering.
  The goals of the UI component system include the following:

  * Simplifying Layout Handle XML files
  * Moving Admin user interface elements from HTML+Javascript to a "pure javascript" custom widget system
  * Enabling the creation of more complex UI components out of smaller components
  * Pre-rendering data for UI components as JSON, binding closely to backend data objects
  * Using AJAX to update component data
  * Introducing a new DSL for creating all of the above
