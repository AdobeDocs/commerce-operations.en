definition: |
  Vendor-produced code that extends or customizes Commerce behavior and operates as a third-party extension is considered a Vendor Bundled Extension (VBE).
  VBEs are thoroughly tested and included with each supported version of Magento Open Source and Adobe Commerce.
  A VBE can include modules, themes, and language packs.
