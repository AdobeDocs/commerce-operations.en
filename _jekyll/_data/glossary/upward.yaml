  [PWA Studio](https://github.com/magento/pwa-studio) uses [UPWARD](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/pwa-studio/guides/packages/upward/) in development.
  UPWARD is an acronym for Unified Progressive Web App Response Definition.
  An UPWARD definition file describes how a web server delivers and supports a Progressive Web Application.

  UPWARD definition files provide details about server behavior using platform-independent, declarative language.
  This allows a Progressive Web Application to run on top of an UPWARD-compliant server in any language on any tech stack because the application is only concerned about the HTTP endpoint behavior from the UPWARD server.

  An UPWARD server uses a definition file to determine the appropriate process or service for a request from an application shell.
  It describes how the server should handle a request and build the response for it.

  A PWA project can include an UPWARD definition file to specify its service dependencies.
