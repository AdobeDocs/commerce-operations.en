# Teams

Ecommerce is one of the fastest-growing segments in the market where brands are rushing to get online. For every ecommerce project to be successful, it is necessary to have the right team balance. Managing an ecommerce business needs a team with experience, strategy and cross-functional skills. Along with the right ecommerce team, it is also essential to have other teams within the organisation to be equally involved in the entire project process and even after go-live. It needs to be a collaborative effort if the business wants to achieve the envisioned goal and to do so the business needs to ensure the departments aren’t working in isolation,

Along with setting up teams, onboarding team members should not be overlooked. On-boarding a member on the team needs to be done in an effective manner as it can define the success of the overall team. The team can be structured in a mixed format such as the team can be co-located, working remotely, and third-party service providers. A successful team can be in-house, co-locates, remote or third-party service but needs to be clearly defined yet needs to be flexible so that the business to minimize cost and maximise efficiency and productivity.

## Marketing

There are tons of tips and tricks out there that can be used for marketing your brand online, some might be great, but some might not work for you. It is not only posting content on social media or sending out emails to customers. It’s the people who create all of this for the business, it’s the marketing team that helps bring traffic on the site, helps drive the ROI, produces campaigns and promotions, manages influences, builds online marketing strategies and so on and so forth. The marketing team is an integral part of ecommerce just like the other teams. They keep the SEO, SEM, loyalty programs, rewards and other related tasks running. Coordination with the marketing team helps drive conversion rate on the site.

If there is no communication or collaboration, there could be issues that crop up. For example, if the inventory level for a certain item is low in the warehouse and the marketing team sends out a promotional email regarding that product, the business could face some angry customers and that would in turn negatively affect the brand name and customer loyalty. There is one shot when it comes to ecommerce, and that needs to be perfect.

## IT

Some businesses take the IT team (technical team) involving the developers - both back end and front end and testers as part of the ecommerce team, whereas some businesses keep them separate. Some businesses prefer to have the entire IT team inhouse, this could be due to security concern, cost, culture, environment or product management.

Alternatively, some businesses prefer to outsource the IT (development) team to consultancy type firms who have more expertise in that area and can help enable the in-house team more effectively. Also, some businesses prefer to have a mix of both.

Ideally, the development and Commerce teams would remain separate, but work together in unity when it comes to setting goals, planning sprints and deploying new features.

## Customer service

Customer Service is usually one of the most overlooked and undervalued teams in an organisation. But in the ecommerce industry, everything is based online, and the customer service team is the only team who have direct day to day contact with the customers. They can provide the marketing, product, and ecommerce employees with important information which can be used to improve and understand what is working and what changes need to be accounted for in the next sprint cycle.

For example, an organisation had the customer service team in the same room as the ecommerce team for the first time. The ecommerce and Marketing team were able to firsthand hear and understand what the customers had to say which was invaluable.

It is important to ensure that the customer service team is involved and consistently providing feedback to the Commerce team, because the information provided is firsthand knowledge of the customer. Any feedback that might be impacting transactions or add to cart behaviour can be quickly addressed and accounted for as part of the roadmap.

## Ecommerce

Ideally, most organisations have a dedicated ecommerce team that manages the day-to-day ecommerce related operations, decisions, strategy, goal, maintenance, and everything related to the success of the online platform. A typical overview of the team members involved in an ecommerce team are:

- Ecommerce manager
- Platform SME
- Product specialist
- Business analyst
- SEO/SEM specialist
- Content manager
- Inventory

In some businesses, these roles overlap with the other team roles or they sit within the ecommerce team, depending on size, revenue and growth targets.

## Warehouse

When a business plans to release an ecommerce site, it is imperative to consider the working of the warehouse because even though ecommerce shopping experience takes place online, packaging and shipping products take place in the physical world. When businesses only focus on the working of the site, they can miss out on the intricate parts of the end-to-end ecommerce experience.

For example, an organisation builds the website, did all the testing and in the end, they found out that their warehouse printer could not print the orders fast enough because of which the warehouse team had to wait to pack the orders which in turn reduced the number of products they were able to package and send out. This not only wasted time but also the orders were being delayed which increased the number of phone calls made by customers to the customer service team which damaged their customer experience and customer loyalty.

## C-level

C level executives always want their organisation to perform at the optimum level and increase the conversion rate to gain returns on investments. For this to happen it is not only important for the different teams in the organisation to be involved and work together but it is also crucial for C level and other top-level executives to be more involved and understand the process of how the goal set is going to be achieved. Having C level and other top-level executives buy-in to a major  ecommerce project is critical to the success of the project overall. Direct engagement is required from the C level as well as proper communication is needed with all the teams involved.

Though at times it does depend whether the project was initiated at the C level or below. Often the project starts with the technology rather than starting with the business. It is usually rare to find a project being initiated at the C level. Due to this very reason, it is necessary to get the C level involved as soon as possible and keep them involved till the very end to bring it all together and to set expectations across the board so that as you move along the project everyone knows what you are doing, why and how the project is being carried out.

When you start the project, the C level and business in mind, they would first look at the KPIs and the ROI but bringing them onto the journey from the very beginning will them understand why this is being done, what the organisation will gain from this and what benefits will all the stakeholders derive from this. For the success of any ecommerce project, it is downright essential from everyone from top-down to be on the equally involved and on the same page.

## Others

There are various other teams that are either part of an existing time or are a stand-alone such as:

- **Content team**—They need to be aligned with all the teams to know that the content being put out there is being well received or not. Content on the site would be required to be updated with time to keep the customers up to date. The content team are responsible for setting up content on the product page, category pages, blog, footer etc. that attracts traffic onto the site to increase conversion rate.

- **Data team**—On an ecommerce site there is a lot of data that can be gathered and analysed. Data such as customer information, spending habits, popular products, time the site has the most footfall etc. all this information is processed by the data team to provide great insight on how the site is functioning and where the site needs more improvement Data can recommend what trends are upcoming and where the business needs to focus on.

- **Finance and accounting team**—Finance and Accounting team - some businesses have a small finance and accounting team which can in-house or outsourced who focus on budgeting, speculating and managing the finance aspect of setting up and running an ecommerce site.
