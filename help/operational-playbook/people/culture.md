# Culture

When working with internal and external customers on a project, it can pay dividends to pay close attention to the corporate culture at hand. Commerce culture refers to the shared beliefs, attitudes and values that an organisationâ€™s members share and are consistent with. Culture helps an organisation reach strategic goals by encouraging desired behaviours, attitudes and ways of working.

Understanding the organisational culture at hand is critical for project success. On any given project, despite the many benefits a new project is projected to deliver for an organisation, this will effectively be reduced to 0 if the changes are not adopted successfully. If the pre-determined culture at play within the organisation is resistant to change, the employees of the organisation may not be receptive to the changes the project is introducing. This can manifest itself in employees failing to adopt the new system, failing to understand the benefits the new system will introduce or worse yet, blaming the system for failing to deliver a full ROI.
