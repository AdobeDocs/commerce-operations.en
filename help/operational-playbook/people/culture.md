# Culture

When working with internal and external customers on a project, it can pay dividends to pay close attention to corporate culture. Corporate culture refers to the shared beliefs, attitudes, and values that an organizationâ€™s members share. Culture helps an organization reach strategic goals by encouraging desired behaviors, attitudes, and ways of working.

Understanding organizational culture is critical for project success. Failure to adopt change effectively puts project success at risk. If the pre-determined culture at play within the organization is resistant to change, the employees of the organization may not be receptive to the changes the project is introducing. This can manifest itself in employees failing to adopt the new system, failing to understand the benefits the new system will introduce, and blaming the system for failing to deliver a full return on investment (ROI).
