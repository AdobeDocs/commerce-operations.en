# Resources

Digital implementation requires resources which can either be internal (in-house) or external (third parties) or a mix of both. A business would need to analyse their in-house team and their capabilities when deciding if they want to execute the entire project in-house or they would need support for an external third party. In most cases, businesses with less digital implementation experience would opt for outsourcing to an external third party. If the business wants to utilise their in-house team, they will need to access team capability and they can also opt for hiring new employees while retaining their digital talent.

## Internal

Some businesses try to develop and recruit people with the required skills to create an in-house team thinking that an e-Commerce site is a continuous development process which can be expensive if the project development is done with an external (third party) entity. To develop an in-house team, businesses need to focus on having the right people in the team with the required skills and capabilities. 

Benefits of an in-house team include:

- Effective and easier communication
- Increased legal protection
- More product ownership from the business and team
- Easier collaboration
- Same culture

When do businesses decide on having an internal team:

- When the business has a highly secured business environment where all the information is sensitive and confidential which cannot be shared with a third party.

- Technology the business is working on is patented and could create legal issues when working with a third party.

- Budgeting issues where the business is only able to afford an internal team.

- Products being sold are highly innovative such as devices, software etc. which cannot be shared with an external team.

There are few cons of operating with an internal team like there is no guarantee on if the team members understand the importance of the project, efficiency, self-motivation, understanding of the product or productivity. 

Overall, internal teams do have several benefits. Thus, the business needs to ensure that they have the right people working in the team who are self-motivated, skilled and have the required capabilities.

## External

When businesses donâ€™t have the required internal team in terms of resources and/or capabilities, then businesses resort to hiring external teams also known as third parties. Third-party resources are hired for a limited time frame where the third-party team consists of the required experience, knowledge, subject matter expert and implementation skills. While developing the project, third-party team also helps to enable the internal team so that they can handle the platform once the third party roles off. Third party resources can be in terms of consultancy, payment gateways, SEO/SEM related activities, marketing etc. Businesses need to analyse and figure out where their internal team lacks so they can hire the required third party. Like any other resources, third parties also have pros and cons.

Pros of an external/third-party team include:

- A specialised organisation has more experience in delivering similar ecommerce projects compared to the internal team which produces economies of scale.

- The team members of the third-party team are more experienced. Like an SME of a platform would know the inside out features of the platform and can suggest best practises that the business can use to maximise the use of the platform.

- Consultancy companies are always pushing their resources to be up to date in terms of technology and trend. Consultants have a flexible working style and bring a lot with them not only in terms of knowledge and experience but also culture.

- Third party can provide people to work on the project in terms of need. Thus, it allows team scalability.

- Working with third-party resources requires the business to be more disciplined in terms of communication, planning and executing the project.

- Quality of the deliverable from a third party is always better than the internal team as they are experienced and have the knowledge to apply and build the requirements of the business.

- Payment gateways are managed and are more secure as the third party is responsible for providing the support and security.

Cons of an external team include:

- Can be quite expensive in the long run.

- The project timeline could fall back, or it could not meet the required expectation.

- There is always a risk of sharing confidential data and security.

- Contracts with third parties can be rigid which can cause issues during the project.

- There could be friction between what the business expects and what the team can provide within the guidelines of the contact.

Overall, based on the pros and cons the business needs to identify their need and what suits them best. Businesses who have little or no experience, opt for external third-party resources who can implement the ecommerce site and train their employees to handle after go-live.

## Hybrid

When a business looks at carrying out a digital implementation, they need to consider a lot of factors from resources, budget, skills, capabilities etc. Some organisations tend to choose a hybrid modal. A hybrid modal consists of both internal and external third-party teams to work together. 

In a hybrid model, the external third-party team would usually carry out the complex bit of the project with the support of the internal team, where the internal team would be responsible to provide all the content, information, integrations etc. to the external team to successfully implement the system. During the project, the third-party resources train the internal team so once the project is delivered the internal team can manage. In a hybrid model, the third-party team becomes an extension of the in-house/internal team which allows better collaboration and communication.
