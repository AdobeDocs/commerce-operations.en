# Communication

Communication is critical to the success of an eccomerce project.

## Communication processes

Creating a strong communication process within any Commerce team is about managing all assets and processes as efficiently as possible and investing in the people that matter. Part of the strategy that businesses need to adopt is about delegating tasks to the right people, or software, in their teams. In general, every  ecommerce business needs to tackle three main groups: product, customer acquisition, and customer retention. Many roles will fall under these three umbrellas.

Listed below are some of the process’s ecommerce businesses should adopt in order to operationally tackle, manage and improve those three groups effectively.

- Create workflow and task management solutions that your team can easily access and understand
- Design an efficient onboarding process
- Create a workflow that employees can use across product management, Commerce operations, order fulfillment and distribution

## Communication tools

It is common knowledge that poor communication within any working relationship is detrimental to any organisation and team. Studies have shown that financial losses per year are in the millions due to inadequate communication between employees. It’s likely that staff take on varied roles and responsibilities, which leads to them being pulled in many directions. Fortunately, there is an array of technology available to help people stay open and connection through clear lines of communication.

We will explore some of these tools, which have been found to be very impactful within large and small organisations.

### JIRA

Application tools for project management and issue tracking have been around for quite some time now. Such tools simplify the communication process among employees and ensure the scalability of the project or platform. JIRA has been known to tick all the boxes when it comes to the exchange of information and fundamental project management. The application allows teams to share more knowledge and information, which lead to a better understanding of business objectives, goals and tasks within any team and thus if used well can improve the collaboration and efficiency within organisations.

The following list includes ways JIRA can be used within any organisation:

- Manageable agile workflows
- Unlimited custom fields and swim lanes
- Bugs and test management
- Seamless source and issue integration
- Search and filtering
- User mentions and multiple assignees
- Project planning
- Task management
- Resource management
- Resource plannings
- Advanced reporting
- Customizable JIRA boards
- Out-of-the-box Kanban and Scrum boards
- Advanced security and administration
- Integration with flexiable REST APIs
- JIRA hosting
- Effectively import data from other systems

#### JIRA workflow example

JIRA allows teams to create and write detailed tasks, generate reports customise workflows and assign jobs across individuals relatively fast. Commerce Managers, Marketing and Development teams, even C stakeholders can track the daily, weekly, month and yearly progress of any given JIR A task or project. The Atlassian project management tool comes in three versions including JIRA Align, JIRA Core and JIRA Software.

The benefits of using JIRA within any  ecommerce business is the ability for multiple teams to collaborate using one platform. Many times, companies witness the marketing, development, creative and Commerce teams all working in their silos. Having a project management tool like JIRA, enables each team to represent all kinds of priorities including documents, tasks or people. Issues can represent anything teams want to track and are all contained within different projects that are made up of recurring tasks teams need to complete. Each issue goes through a process called a workflow.

The right workflow can make or break communication lines. Teams can create their own workflows to define the steps an issue follows toward completion. Jira allows for business to customise workflows to suit their business requirements and obligations while easily matching how teams work most efficiently. As issues are tracked throughout a workflow, all members of the team, department, or even business gain visibility into their status. A workflow also ensures that an issue passes all the steps before it’s complete—that’s how teams never forget any of these priorities.

### Confluence

Creating a rich knowledge and information bank can be tedious. It takes a willing team to come together and give attention to creating processes around how documentation is managed. When done correctly, however, creating a proactive knowledge base can dramatically shave the number of issues in your support queue and save your team hours of work.

Whether you are launching or maintaining a website, documenting the fundamental Commerce processes, Confluence is an interactive space where individuals from across the business can come and create, plan and give feedback on all types of documentation.

Commerce teams can create standardised templates and checklists for deployment preparations, product launches, how-to-articles, test scripts and troubleshooting to name a few. In addition, the Confluence application, owned by Atlassian is a nice extension to JIRA, where the two applications can work hand in hand harmoniously. The content created is easily accessible to teams that sit across the organisation and allows everyone to collaborate on topics in one space.

### Stand-ups

In the world of start-ups, stand-ups were born. And it is now more than ever; we are seeing businesses review their process around meetings. Research has found that in general employees prefer fewer meetings, but to have a clear line of communication and openness, getting people together occasionally is important for the success of any business and more specifically  ecommerce operations.

Therefore, as a more casual alternative to long and rigid meetings, companies of all sizes have moved to a more relaxed stand-up style of meeting. The culture of stand-ups within any Commerce team allows for short and quick discussions, where all members are given the chance to talk, goals are set, and strong team bonds maintained.

The use of stand-ups within any Commerce team are particularly useful when planning for deployments, managing deliverables and debugging issues.

## Team communication

Team communication skills are taught in many different settings, but company culture sets the tone of any

Here are some tips for how to improve communication:

- Keep your messages clear, use simple language, and stay away from jargon. Although your teams may be expected to know Commerce terminology, jargon can still impede understanding.
- Meet your team where they feel comfortable, whether that is through traditional written or video messages sent via email.
- Use JIRA and Confluence for project management, planning and documentation of Commerce processes
- Manage stand-ups to be short and impactful for the whole team
