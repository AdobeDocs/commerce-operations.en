# Project teams

Every brick-and-mortar store needs a team and it’s the same for an online  ecommerce store thus is very important to have people in your team who fit best to the role with the required skillset. Be in a B2B or B2C  ecommerce, it is essential for each department in the organisation to be involved in the  ecommerce project. There are direct and indirect dependencies between departments which help to achieve the set goal for the project team. It is key that each individual understands what the team is working towards, what is the end goal and how we have to reach there together. Getting someone on board in the internal  ecommerce team who does not know the platform well or who is not aligned, will only tend to slow things down and increase pressure on the other team members.

There is a dependency on the size of the team based on the complexity of the project.

## Key team roles

- Project Manager
- Technical Architect
- Functional Lead
- Business Analyst
- Backend Developers
- frontend Developers
- Designer
- Content Manager
- Tester

Each of the individuals mentioned above is responsible for planning and executing the  ecommerce project. But at times it is not only these individuals who are responsible.

## External dependencies

Organisations tend to overlook the external dependencies who could directly or indirectly play an important part in the success of the project, such as the:

- **Warehouse team**-For example, if the website is all up and running but the staff in the warehouse is limited, that would mean there could be a delay in packing and sending the products out or if there was a system issue in the warehouse which could not keep up with the number of orders being placed that would again delay package.

- **Customer service team**—They are the only ones who are in direct contact with the customer, they are aware of the pain points and the linking’s of the customers, yet they are usually the most underrated team in an organisation. For example, if there is a new promotion being set out on the website and the team is not aware it could be possible, they might not be able to provide the correct information which would affect customer experience or if there is a promotion out and the team size is small then they would not be able to keep up with the number
of calls which again would affect customer
experience.

- **Marketing team**—Marketing team would handle sales, offers etc. and if they were to send out emails regarding a product and they were not aware that the stock is limited then it could create a bad impression on the customers which would lower the conversion rate.

When setting up the project team it is not only essential to have the correct people with the required skill set in the team but also to ensure the external teams are in sync with the project and the workings to be aligned to achieve a successful result.
