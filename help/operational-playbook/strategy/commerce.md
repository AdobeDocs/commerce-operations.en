# Commerce strategy

Digital commerce is a rapidly moving force, that evolves expeditiously each year. While this can be exciting for individuals, it also comes with many challenges for organisations trying to navigate the lay of the land that is Commerce.

As commerce continues to evolve in both B2B and B2C, businesses are seeing drastic changes in customer behaviours and expectations, from the way they research a product/service, consider and complete a purchase, or show loyalty to a brand, to the way they communicate all of this to their peers. Customer behaviours and expectations can shift instantly, and businesses can struggle to adapt to new market trends and creating a digital strategy that is both realistic and achievable.

Therefore, the execution and planning of any digital strategy is key to any successful e-Commerce business.
