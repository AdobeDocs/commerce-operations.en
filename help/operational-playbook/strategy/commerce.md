# Commerce strategy

Digital commerce is a rapidly moving force that evolves expeditiously each year. While this can be exciting for individuals, it also comes with many challenges for organizations trying to navigate the lay of the land that is ecommerce.

As ecommerce continues to evolve in both B2B and B2C, businesses are seeing drastic changes in customer behaviors and expectations; from the way they research a product/service, consider and complete a purchase, or show loyalty to a brand, to the way they communicate all of this to their peers. Customer behaviors and expectations can shift instantly and businesses can struggle to adapt to new market trends and create a digital strategy that is both realistic and achievable.
