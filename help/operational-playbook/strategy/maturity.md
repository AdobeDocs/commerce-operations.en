# Maturity model

A maturity model is a formula for businesses to use to determine what stage they're at with any given functional area or strategy. A useful and accurate maturity model will help businesses understand how to advance from one stage to another through their commerce roadmap.

Think of a maturity model as a robust chart/ report with all the information needed to know how to improve an area of the platform, which acts as a road map for progress.

The following diagram summarizes the different needs across maturity levels:

## Levels of maturity

The following table summarizes the different levels of maturity:

| Variable | B2B |
-----------|----------|
| Crawl | The entry level for e-commerce maturity consists of the easiest to reach  tasks by a single marketer. The business normally progresses through to  build upon the basics to further enhance the customer experience.|
| Walk | At this level, organisations are starting to leverage past customer data  coming from multiple sources, needing multi-departmental collaboration.  Organisations within this level can use the full potential of campaigns  managed by people and have a mature set of best practices, processes and  development stream. |
| Run | The highest level of maturity enables AI-powered campaigns across various  channels and uses predictive stock management to prevent churn, product  information management tools to enrich products. It is best achievedby organizations with an evolved data culture, development skills and processes in house and offshore. |

### Crawl

This is the initial phase for any business, the starting point. In this phase, businesses need to focus on delivering a presentable, easy to navigate, user-friendly and simple checkout style of ecommerce platform, which is equipped with the basic features required in an ecommerce site. Businesses need to check if they already have a pricing system in place or would they require a pricing system.

If they require a pricing system, they will need to understand the payment gateway providers out in the market and which suits best to their needs, who are experienced, fits the budget and provides the service and security required. Payment gateways will process the transaction payments independently from the website, which would allow the team to focus more on the site and the payment information will not get stored on the website.

Once the business decides the payment gateway provider, they would need to analyse the required payment methods, the ones that are popular among the customers. Being new to the ecommerce platform, some businesses choose to offer limited payment method options as each option has a setup and on- going costs which could be a heavy upfront investment. As a basic, businesses in the crawl phase do offer credit and debit card and then branch out to payment methods like PayPal and Afterpay. Once they see there is traffic on the site and the traffic is leading to increased conversion rate.

Overall, businesses in the crawl phase should develop a well-integrated ecommerce system to get it started and off the ground before they expand to add-on more features.

### Walk

Businesses in the walk phase begin to develop the site based on the customers they have, insights and the experience they have had with their existing ecommerce site. In this phase, businesses can start implementing more complex features to provide new offerings to their customers to increase customer experience and customer loyalty.

Business in the walk phase have features like blogs, videos, feature sections, product variations and purchase of the product is easily accessible on the web pages. In the walk phase, businesses already understand the purchase trend of their customers through the data and the feedback which allows them to improve their process including their pricing. Businesses in the walk phase are in a place where they can implement multiple payment methods such as credit/debit, more than one option for electronic wallet and/or gift cards. Providing multiple payment options gives the customers the liberty to choose the one they are comfortable with. They also have the option to opt for a larger payment gateway provider who can manage more than one payment method.

Overall, businesses in the walk phase have the advantage to improve their site and payment methods based on customer data.

### Run

In the run phase, businesses have a complete understanding of their customers and their purchase behaviour which helps them to set a goal where they can expand their business outward. In the run phase, businesses can set a goal to achieve complex requirements, marketing, multiple global payment methods or global shipping.

Having an in-depth understanding of the customers, market, internal and external team, the website can allow businesses in the run phase to implement custom features that are unique to the site like recommending the payment methods most used by  the customer, provide services like subscriptions for the registered user where they can get free shipping discounts or offers on their transactions and more.

Implementing more complex features be it in shipping, product or payment can be easily done by the businesses in the run phase as they have already achieved the market share and are confident that investing in these will help them improve their customer service and make their customers keep coming back.
