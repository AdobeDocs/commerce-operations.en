# Project scope

Project scope is an integral part of a project plan that outlines the goals, deliverables, costs, tasks, and deadlines. Project scope defines project limits, each team member's responsibilities, and sets the procedure for executing the project plan.

In-scope and out-of-scope items are defined in the project scope, which helps you differentiate between approved requirements and scope creep. Following the in-scope items helps the project to stay on track and hand over the deliverables on time by staying within the budget. The project scope also helps teams make decisions on changes that occur during the project. Changes are bound to happen when the project is ongoing and if the project is well-scoped in the beginning it is easier to manage changes later.

Scope creep is a common situation in projects where stakeholders request additional work. It happens when requirements change or because of miscommunication during planning. A well-written project plan and clear communication helps you avoid scope creep.

There are some benefits of having a well-written project scope:

- Outlines what the project includes
- Acts as a roadmap that all teams and stakeholders can use
- Defines the project objectives the team is working towards
- Prevents and helps manage scope creep
- Defines the scope of work that the team needs to complete

Overall, project scope provides a strong foundation for executing a project plan.
