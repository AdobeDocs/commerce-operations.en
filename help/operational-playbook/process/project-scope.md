# Project scope

Project Scope is an integral part of a Project Plan which outlines the goals, deliverables, costs, tasks, deadlines etc. Project scope defines the project limits, each team members responsibilities and sets the procedure of how the project needs to be done. In-scope and out of scope items are defined in the project scope which helps to track what requirement was signed off and what is a scope creep. Following the in-scope items helps the project to stay on track and hand over the deliverables on time by staying within the budget. The project scope also helps to take decisions on changes that occur during the project. Changes are bound to happen when the project is ongoing and if the project is well scoped in the beginning it will be easier to manage any changes that crop up.

Projects will never be as planed out there will be scope creep that would occur, a situation when there is additional work requested which takes more time and this could happen due to change in requirement or miscommunication. To avoid such situations or manage scope creep, a well-written project scope acts as a guide to understand what in- scope is and what is a scope creep.

There are some benefits of having a well-written project scope:

- Outlines what the project consists of
- Acts a road map that can be used by the project team and/or any stakeholder involved in the project
- Define the project objectives the team is working towards
- Prevents and helps manage scope creep
- Defines the scope of work that the team needs to work towards

Overall Project Scope provides a strong foundation for carrying out the project.
