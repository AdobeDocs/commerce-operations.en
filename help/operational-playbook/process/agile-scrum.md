# Agile Scrum methodology

Agile is a time-boxed, iterative approach to project management and software delivery that focuses on delivering incremental value to customers quickly and continuously  rather than a traditional waterfall approach that takes much longer.

Scrum is an example of a framework based on Agile and is often used on many ecommerce teams. Recently, there has been a shift away from traditional waterfall styles of project delivery to Agile or Scrum-based delivery. This is due to the increased transparency, collaboration, and faster time-to-market that these frameworks provide.

Scrum encourages self-organised, cross-functional teams to solve problems together in a time-boxed period called a "sprint". The Scrum team is self-organising in that there is no leader and the team is cross-functional so that everyone needs to take a feature from idea to implementation.

In the Scrum methodology, there are several meetings that are used to drive transparency and progress on a ecommerce project:

- **Sprint planning**—A planning meeting where team members come together to decide how much work can be completed in a sprint.

- **Daily scrum**—A 15-minute meeting used to share updates about what each team member is working on.

- **Sprint review**—A meeting used to demonstrate progress from the sprint.

- **Sprint retrospective**—A meeting used to reflect on the previous sprint and to identify opportunities for improvement.

At the end of each sprint, an increment of value (for example, new features, bug fixes, upgrades, or general code updates) should be delivered and releasable to customers.
