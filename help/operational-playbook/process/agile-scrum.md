# Agile Scrum methodology

Agile is a time-boxed, iterative approach to project management and software delivery which focuses on delivering incremental value to customers faster and continuously, compared to a traditional, waterfall approach. Scrum is an example of a framework based on agile and is often used in many Commerce delivery units. In recent times, there has been a shift away from traditional or waterfall styles of project delivery towards agile or scrum-based delivery. This is due to the increased transparency, collaboration and faster time-to-market that these frameworks provide.

Scrum encourages self-organised, cross-functional teams to solve problems together in a time-boxed period called a ‘sprint’. The scrum team is self-organising in that there is no leader, and the team is cross-functional so that everyone is needed to take a feature from idea to implementation.

In Scrum methodology, there are several meetings which are used to drive transparency and progress on a Commerce project:

- **Sprint planning**—a planning meeting where team members come together to decide how much work can be completed in a ‘sprint’

- **Daily scrum**—a 15-minute meeting used to share updates of what each team member is working on

- **Sprint review**—A meeting used to demonstrate progress from the sprint

- **Sprint retrospective**—a meeting used to reflect on the previous sprint and to identify opportunities for improvement

At the end of each sprint, an increment of value, new features, bug fixes, upgrades or general code updates should be delivered and
releasable to customers.
