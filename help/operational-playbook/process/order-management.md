# Order management

For brand new businesses the order levels are low, and it is easier to
complete the orders at a low cost but when the demand rises, the orders increase, and it becomes difficult to handle the orders with a small team or by yourself at a lower cost. You might need a bigger place like a warehouse or more than one warehouse depending on the nature of the business which can be costly and would require more manpower. This is where Order Management comes to play.

Order management helps to meet the changing requirements and the changing operational needs to be able to manage the demand, inventory, packaging and shipping. Integrating an Order Management System to the Platform can help businesses meet their changing requirements, drive customer satisfaction, customer retention, higher conversion rate and brand loyalty.
