# Project management

Project management can be defined as the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to project activities in order to achieve goals and meet project requirements successfully. There are five phases of project management, and the project management life cycle provides an overview of this process.

Scrum helps to overall manage changes during the project, allows team to give quick results, is flexible and increases collaboration.

## Basic project plan

A basic ecommerce project management plan would include:

- **Analysis**—In the initial stage of a project the business would need to conduct analysis which includes market, competitor and business analysis to understand the organisations strengths and weaknesses.

- **Requirements**—Lay out detailed requirements of what the organisation wants in the end of the project in terms of enhancing existing skills and/or implementing new features and/or integrations.

- **Third-party providers**—In this stage map out the integrations which would be required by a 3rd party for example payment, shipping, ratings, reviews and so on.

- **Design**—Plan of using existing templates, company's brand book etc. To brainstorm the requirements which are design specific.

- **Migration**—Plan out the steps that would be taken when migrating content, data etc.

- **Ecommerce platform**—Analyse and finalise the platform required for the business to meet the requirements.

## Best practices

Some best practices that businesses can refer to for project management:

- Set clear, precise and trackable goals
- Monitor the time spent on tasks and/or resources to avoid wastage
- Select the correct e-commerce tools required by the team such as the ecommerce platform, communication tools etc.
- Constant testing and iteration should be conducted
- Track budget
