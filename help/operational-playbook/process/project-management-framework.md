# Project management framework

The DACI model is a project management framework used to clearly  define the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders on a  project, leading to effective and efficient group decisions. The DACI  stands for Driver, Approver, Contributor and Informed. These roles  make it clear who has authority in certain areas and situations,  allowing a project to progress smoothly.
