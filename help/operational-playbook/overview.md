# Operational playbook

The objective of this playbook is to get your businesses operationally ready to run a successful ecommerce site. This helps you and your organization as users derive maximum value from your technology investments. Although we have seen many websites succeed, others have faltered due to a lack of internal investment in the businesses to ensure they are operationally ready to run an ecommerce site successfully.

We created this playbook for all industries and customers (B2C and B2B) to use as part of their day-to-day ecommerce operations and the successful management of their ecommerce platform.

This playbook is designed to help you avoid some of the common mistakes that we have identified in less successful ecommerce website management and delivery teams. The recommendations and best practices in this playbook are intended to be applied to any industry and business in parallel with your technology solution to ensure that your business is positioned to realize value from your investment and use the platform end-to-end.

The playbooks in this series use a common digital governance structure focusing on the key areas of leadership, strategy, people, solution, product, and process to deliver a robust approach to readying your business whether you are deploying a new feature on your platform or planning a robust ecommerce road map on Adobe Commerce.

The target audience for this playbook includes:

- Chief Marketing Officer
- Head of Digital, Head of Strategy, Head of Marketing
- Head of Content, Head of UX, Content Production Lead, Content Strategist, Content Producers, UX Designer
- Solution Architect, Head of Implementation, Lead Developer
