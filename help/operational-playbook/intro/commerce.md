# Adobe Commerce

Magento is the leading platform for open commerce innovation. Every year, Magento handles over $100 billion in gross merchandise volume. Magento Commerce gives customers the power to create unique and engaging shopping experiences, out-of-the-box features, and the unlimited ability to customise, a flexible headless architecture, and seamless third-party integrations.

There are two versions of the Magento platform:

_Magento Open Source_ is the free version of Magento, previously called Magento Community. You can download, customize, and run the platform on your own server or Magento host of choice.

The majority of merchants use Magento Open Source because of the low cost and open nature. For developers, it doesnâ€™t really matter if he develops on Open Source or Commerce. But Commerce has more built-in features that can be used out of the box.

_Magento Commerce_ is the paid version of Magento, previously known as Magento Enterprise. Being the premium version, there are a lot of additional features from Magento Commerce.

Magento Commerce can be hosted on-premise. So you host and develop locally on your own server, or have the choice of your own Magento host. Alternatively, there is Magento Commerce Cloud, the cloud-hosted solution from Adobe.
