# Adobe Commerce

Adobe Commerce is the leading platform for open commerce innovation. Every year, Adobe Commerce handles over $100 billion in gross merchandise volume. Adobe Commerce gives customers the power to create unique and engaging shopping experiences, out-of-the-box features, and the unlimited ability to customize, a flexible headless architecture, and seamless third-party integrations.

There are two versions of [!DNL Commerce]:

_Magento Open Source_ is the free version, previously called Magento Community. You can download, customize, and run the platform on your own server or hosting provider of your choice.

The majority of merchants use Magento Open Source because of the low cost and open nature. For developers, it doesnâ€™t really matter if they develop on Magento Open Source or Adobe Commerce. However, Adobe Commerce has more built-in features that can be used out of the box.

_Adobe Commerce_ is the paid version, previously known as Magento Enterprise. Being the premium version, there are a lot of additional features.

Adobe Commerce can be hosted on-premises. So you host and develop locally on your own server or you can choose a hosting provider. Alternatively, there is Adobe  Commerce on cloud infrastructure, the cloud-hosted solution from Adobe. In the Solution section, we look deeper into the differences between hosted (e.g., SaaS, on-premises) and PaaS hosting solutions.
