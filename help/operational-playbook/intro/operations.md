# Commerce operations

Commerce operations is about centralizing backend operations so that they work smarter, faster, and more efficiency. A successful operational strategy requires a strong IT infrastructure that is capable of supporting end-to-end ecommerce operations; product catalog, inventory management, checkout, and shipping. Ecommerce operations are built on several things, such as a user-friendly storefront, variety of products, proper management of inventory, promotions, easy checkout, and convenient payment and shipping methods.

## Why is ecommerce operation strategy important?

Ecommerce is based on a direct-to-consumer strategy. It is essential that customers receive the best customer experience for them to keep coming back. 

Steps you can take include:

- Understanding the products you are hosting on the site and the target audience that you are catering to. This leads to a higher conversion rate.
- Finding the right platform, which is not only secure but also scalable. It should have different features and functionality that are not over complicated for the team to manage.
- Building the right team that includes people with the required skills set to achieve the project vision.
- Creating and follow a project plan that covers team requirements, timelines, and deliverables.
- Establishing a clear project scope that mentions the singed-off/agreed in-scope and out-of-scope items to avoid scope creep and delay on the project deliverables.
- Monitoring internal and external costs to make sure the project stays on budget.

An ecommerce operations strategy is important to providing your customers with the best experience. Better commerce operations means better focus and speed on selling products online.
