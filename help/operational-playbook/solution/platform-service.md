# Platform-as-a-service (PaaS)

PaaS is a type of cloud computing which offers service to deliver a platform to clients allowing them to develop, run, and manage the business without the requirement to build an infrastructure to manage the services.

PaaS is provided as a service which is hosted on the provider's infrastructure and can be accessed using the Internet on the browser. Most of the e-commerce platforms function as a PaaS which means the site does not need to build from scratch.

PaaS works on all types of cloud private, public, and hybrid:

- PaaS with Private cloud: PaaS is delivered within the client's firewall for security, where the data is stored on-premise.
- PaaS with Public cloud: The client is in control of the deployments and the provider is responsible for all the other components such as network, operating system etc.
- PaaS with Hybrid cloud: Hybrid mixes the functions of both private and public so that the client can have flexibility

## Advantages

- Allows to build and deploy without the requirement to spend money and time on building infrastructure such as servers
- Allows faster deployments and delivery
- Gives a competitive advantage
- Allows the user of new languages, technology, systems etc.
- More flexible
- Access to the code of the website
- Allows to integrate with external 3rd party systems or software
- Self-hosted
- Accessibility
- Cost-effective
- Time-effective

## Disadvantages

- Could lead to a security threat as everything is stored on the cloud
- Dependant on the service provider
- If the provider experiences a down-time it would be an issue for the
client
- Allows easy and quick updates

When the client uses PaaS in e-commerce, they do no need to manage the system and operating software. The client is provided with a platform to set up their e-commerce site where they build and configure content, code data, products etc. which is separate from the administration side of things related to PaaS. 

Due to its flexibility, it is easier to implement changes on the website without requiring updating the entire system. PaaS allows clients to build and test in development or staging sandbox before going live so that there is no issue or downtime on the production site.
