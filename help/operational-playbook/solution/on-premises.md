# On-premises hosting

Cloud based solutions are extremely popular, and it certainly serves an
important role in many organisations, however on-premise infrastructure is still a suitable option for some organisations and merchants.

Several factors come into play, including significant sunk costs, a readily available pool of competent/cost effective IT expertise, and the fact that on-premises applications can often be more readily tailored and adapted to an organisation's needs.

When compliance regulations (i.e, when data must reside locally), on-premises hosting solutions are more advisable. Many organisations are more likely to stick with on-premises when they are still depreciating their hardware and software costs along with no compelling technical or economic reason to change.
