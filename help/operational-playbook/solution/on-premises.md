# On-premises hosting

Cloud-based hosting solutions are extremely popular and it certainly serves an
important role in many organizations, however, on-premises infrastructure is still a suitable option for some organizations and merchants.

You need to consider several factors before choosing on-premises hosting, including significant sunk costs, a readily available pool of competent/cost-effective IT expertise, and the fact that on-premises applications can often be more readily tailored and adapted to an organization's needs.

When compliance regulations, such as when data must be stored in a specific geographic location, on-premises hosting solutions are more advisable. Many organizations are more likely to stick with on-premises hosting when they are still depreciating their hardware and software costs and they have no compelling technical or economic reason to change.
