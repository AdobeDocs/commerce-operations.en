# Upgrades, backups, and maintenance

Maintaining the strong code base, features, functionality and keeping a high-security level are crucial to having a competitive e-commerce store.

There are multiple ways to efficiently upgrade the e-Commerce site depending on the infrastructure available, this process will vary from business to business. Depending on the technical maturity, this can be a very challenging and costly exercise for business to undergo. In the above table, the advantages and disadvantages of managing upgrades on a Cloud vs on-premise were detailed.

Firstly, always important to back up files before running an upgrade.

## Why upgrading makes sense

Since change and adaptation to new customer behaviors is the norm, being on an older platform makes accommodating or imitating new technology and behaviors more expensive and time-consuming, or may simply not be possible. Additionally, as more and more developers move their focus on new technology, the scheduling and cost of retrofit projects may be prohibitive.

By upgrading, you're future-proofing your business and giving yourself the ability to better service changing customer needs

## Planning your upgrade

Here's a quick list of questions you should ask as you plan your
upgrade:

- **Site cleanup**—What can I keep and what can change? What new things do I want to implement? (e.g. what changes do I want to make to taxonomy and product structure, or changes to content).
- **Analytics check**—What are my current KPIs? What does my data tell me about how my site could be improved? Are there new KPIs that I want implemented for my new site?
- **Extensions**—Do I still need them? Which third parrty extensions cover my needs?
- **Integrations**—What third-party systems (e.g. ERP, accounting), do I integrate with? Do they have specific connectors or are custom integrations needed?
- **Training**—Does the upgrade team have the right knowledge and training? What's
my plan to train end users on how to use the new admin before it
goes live?
- **Upgrade team**—Who will be dedicated to the upgrade project, both in-house and external experts? Do they have the necessary support from leadership and other internal teams?

## Common upgrade questions

Q: How long does a typical upgrade take?

A: It depends on the platform and architecture. There are a lot of variables, and if you're also doing a redesign, it will take longer. After the discovery process is complete, your implementation team will be able to give you a more accurate timeframe for your project.


Q: How much does it cost to upgrade?

A: Again, it depends on your current situation and your requirements for your new site. The good news is that generally as partners and developers have become more familiar and adept with your Commerce platform, upgrade costs and projects lengths have come down. We recommend consulting with your Solution Partner for an estimate.

Q: Are Adobe Commerce 2 versions of my Adobe Commerce 1 extensions available? 

A: Virtually all business-critical needs are covered. From content and customizations and shipping and fulfillment to site optimization, we've seen a dramatic increase in the number, and diversity, of extensions in the Commerce Marketplace as merchant adoption of, and partner familiarity with, Adobe Commerce 2 has grown. 

Examples of leading global technology companies who have created extensions include:

- PayPal
- dotmailer
- TaxJar
- Nosto
- Adobe
- Fastly
- Vertex

Also, quality assurance checks implemented for all extensions ensure consistently high product quality, so there is a very high probability that your extension or a high-quality alternative to your extension is already in Commerce Marketplace.

Many merchants have found that the native capabilities in Adobe Commerce 2 have reduced their need and reliance on extensions, simplifying development and maintenance operations and improving overall performance. If you haven't already, engage in thorough upgrade planning to uncover these types of opportunities.

Q: What if my extensions and integrations are not compatible with the platform? 

A: Depending on the platform flexibility and hosting solution different customisation options maybe an option for most software and systems. These customisations would be developed during the upgrade process.


Q: How will my SEO be impacted?
A: With proper planning, your SEO should be improved. Our partner Corra recommends:

- Creating a succinct 301 redirect plan
- Building a strategy around URL taxonomy
- Doing an XML sitemap check
- Working with tag management (e.g., Google)
- Discussing in detail with your implementation team
