# Third-party integrations

As most business understand, when developing an online store, many
unique strategies and processes need to be considered  as part of the overall digital roadmap. Sometimes, the platform alone does not provide all the features and functionality needed to operate a storefront at the optimal level. Which is why merchants turn to third party providers to fill the gaps and move the Commerce operations forward.

Most operational needs can be fulfilled using different software platforms including ERP, marketplace, business intelligence tools, accounting software, reporting suites, and many more. The additional software is selected to reduce time and effort for the organisation, whilst optimising the customer experience and business operations.

When selecting a third-party provider, businesses should use a simple
and effective approach of third-party integration as per the customer's
needs. After understanding the need of the customer, decide on a detailed plan with the help of the stakeholder. After deciding the plan, set up a specification document that defines how the system communicates and what kind of data will be required and passed onto the third party.

>Most integrations are available via an API, which allows systems to communicate with each other. But the problem is that all platforms are not supported via an API, so understanding what is possible from a technical perspective is paramount.
