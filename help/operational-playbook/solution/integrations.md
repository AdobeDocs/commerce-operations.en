# Third-party integrations

Most businesses understand that many unique strategies and processes need to be considered as part of the overall digital roadmap when developing an online store. Sometimes, the platform alone does not provide all of the features and functionality needed to operate a storefront at the optimal level, which is why merchants turn to third-party providers to fill the gaps and move ecommerce operations forward.

Most operational needs can be fulfilled using different software platforms including ERP, marketplace, business intelligence tools, accounting software, reporting suites, and many more. The additional software is selected to reduce time and effort for the organization while optimizing customer experience and business operations.

When selecting a third-party provider, businesses should use a simple
and effective approach for integration that meets their needs. After understanding customer needs, decide on a detailed plan with the help of the stakeholder. After deciding on the plan, set up a specification document that defines how the system communicates and what kind of data is required and passed onto the third party.

>Most integrations are available via an API, which allows systems to communicate with each other. The problem is that all platforms are not supported via an API, so understanding what is possible from a technical perspective is paramount.
