# Software-as-a-service (SaaS)

More businesses are turning to Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) apps and systems to optimise and forge business functions whilst better managing their e-Commerce operations.

Using a SaaS e-Commerce platform instead of open source or on-premise software can seem overwhelming for any size organisation. It feels like an even more daunting decision if you're planning on switching platforms.

SaaS e-Commerce platforms operate in a software licensing and cloud-based delivery model, which users access via a web browser.

One of the benefits of SaaS platforms is that the software isn't installed on-premise or maintained by the user themselves. Instead, your e-Commerce system run on the SaaS provider's hosted servers. The third-party provider is responsible for the security, performance, and maintenance of the application on their servers. Normally, SaaS licensing models operate on a subscription basis, where users pay a monthly fee based on level of service and number of users. This kind of operating model is usually a cost-effective way for merchants to have real-time access to their e-Commerce platform.

## Advantages

- Leveraging out-of-the-box solutions
- Maintenance
- Security and PCI compliance
- Scalability
- Easy integration

### Leveraging out-of-the-box solutions

SaaS e-Commerce platforms are out-of-the-box solutions, where users leverage intuitive, user-friendly interfaces. In general, SaaS projects can be up and running within a short amount of time, which allows merchants to operate the e-Commerce platform using the prebuilt themes, features and functionality rapidly. 

### Maintenance

One of the core advantages of a SaaS e-Commerce platform is the maintenance. The provider is responsible for hosting and maintaining the software, uptime, performance, updates and bug fixes to the software. In turn, the e-Commerce or IT teams can focus on developing the code base of the online store, whilst the SaaS provider (aka Adobe Commerce) can improve the infrastructure.


### Security and PCI compliance

Part of selling goods or services online is ensuring the store is meeting PCI compliance standards, so customer data such as payment information is safeguarded. In a SaaS e-Commerce model, this responsibility sits with the SaaS provider, as its their responsibility to stay up to date with any patches or bug fixes which may impact the security of the store.

### Scalability

As thriving retailers need e-Commerce platforms to scale, take on more customers, process more orders, and add more complex functionality when needed. SaaS e-Commerce platforms tend to be more robust and agile, when trying to accommodate these growth spurts. Businesses can easily increase their bandwidth on servers to deal with increased load and traffic, this is especially important during peak periods, sales, campaigns and new product drops.

### Integrations

Even though e-Commerce platforms sit at the core of most businesses, it's not always the only system organisations use to run all operations. In most cases, SasS e-Commerce platforms will be required to integrate with an ERP, POS, 3PL, or any other financial software. Most SaaS platforms have powerful APIs that make integrations easier because there isn't as much customisation required.

It is recommended that retailers should use best of breed systems meaning that they use the best system for each part of their business. Most of the time, choosing one platform to perform all aspects and functions of your business falls short of your expectations.

Instead, businesses should be able to use any number of best systems for
their ERP, POS, 3PL and e-Commerce systems. Then, integrate those systems so you can sync inventory, orders, customers, items, and shipping/tracking data, thus automating your business processes. Cloud-based, SaaS platforms often allow for this business requirements to happen with flexibility and ease.
