# Personalization

The baseline of ecommerce business growth is customer loyalty. Keeping the customers happy is a combination of a lot of factors from products, content, checkout, customer, and service experience. Personalization depends on AI, which tracks customer information in real-time and delivers a unique, personalized experience. Personalization might not work for all types of businesses, but it’s an additional feature that can help drive traffic to your site.

Personalization should include:

- Meet customer needs

- Provide customers with appropriate product recommendation based on their history

- Segment their customers and products

## Examples

Examples of personalization include:

- **Customer interest**—Changing homepage and navigation based on customer profile. For example, if a user has visited the site previously and explored the women’s section, then next time when they enter the URL they're navigated to the women’s homepage.

- **Recommended products**—Recommend products based on the customers browsing behavior.

- **Search**—Display personalized search results based on a customers previous search behavior.

- **Email**—Send personalized emails about products if a customer has left the item in their cart, or if the product was out of stock send a notification when it is back in stock.

- **Geo-location**—Displaying multiple geo-locations for the site. For example, a customer visits the AU site, but the US site option is also displayed to give the customer a choice.

- **Discount code**—Display specific category discount codes to promote products of a particular category.

- **Complementary products**—Display complementary products when the customer visits a product. For example, a customer views a dress and can view complimentary products like shoes, bags, and accessories that go with the dress.

- **Personalized homepage**—Display a personalized homepage for a registered user to make them feel special.
