# Personalization

The baseline of ecommerce business growth is customer loyalty. Keeping the customers happy is a combination of a lot of factors from products, content, checkout, customer and service experience. Personalisation depends on AI which tracks customer information in real-time and delivers a personalised unique experience. Personalisation might not work for all types of business but it’s an additional feature which helped to drive traffic on the site.

Personalization should include:

- Meet customer needs

- Provide customers with appropriate product recommendation based on their history

- Segment their customers and products

## Examples

There are several personalisation examples such as:

- **Customer interest**—Changing homepage and navigation based on customer profile, for example, if the user has visited the site previously and explored the women’s section then next time when they enter the URL, they would be navigated to the women’s homepage

- **Recommended products**—Recommend products based on the customers browsing behaviour

- **Search**—Display personalised search results based on customers previous search behaviour

- **Email**—Send personalised emails about products if the customer has left the item in the cart or the product was out of order to send a notification it is back in stock etc.

- **Geo-location**—Displaying multiple geo-location of the site, for example, a customer visits the AU site, but the US site option is also displayed to give the customer a choice

- **Discount code**—Display specific category discount codes to promote products of a particular category

- **Complementary products**—Display complementary products when the customer visits a product e.g., customer visits a dress, and they can view complimentary products like shoes, bags and accessories that would go with the dress

- **Personalised homepage**—Display a personalised homepage for the registered user to make them feel special
