# Customer service

ECommerce is digitally based and the only team who interacts with the real customer behind the transaction is the customer service team. Customers expect high-quality customer experience and if they do not get that retailers could lose their customers. The highest number of calls, messages and/or emails received by the customer service is in the ecommerce industry compared to others.

Retailers need to be pro-active in terms of customer service as not only the brand name is at stake but most importantly, its the customer’s loyalty. For retailers to be successful in providing the best customer experience, there are some best practises can they can follow:

- **Multi support channel**—Providing service just visa email or phone is not enough in today’s era. Customer service needs to be provided on various channels such as live chats, emails, phone calls, social media and or text messages. Each of these has their own pros and cons which retailers would need to analyse and select which one or which combination would suit them the best

- **Personalised service**—All of the activity done by the customer is done online which the retailers can track to understand the customer behaviour. For example, when a customer reaches out to the customer service team, the team will have their information beforehand such as their name, email, order history, returns etc. this helps not only the customer service to provide quick and accurate service but also the customer gets a personalised service

- **Self-service**—Customers can also be provided with self-service such as providing FAQ’s, privacy policy, terms and conditions, forums etc.

Retailers should put themselves in the customer’s shoes to understand their problem which will help them provide the best customer experience. Customer experience keeps the customer loyal and promotes the brand.

## B2B vs B2C

Customer service is important for both B2B and B2C businesses, but concept of customer service is difference between the two such as:

- B2B tend to have involves a lot of stakeholder’s and more complex issues which would take more
time and effort to resolve whereas B2C usually consist of regular issues

- B2B businesses have fewer customers but it is essential to provide the best customer service to retain those customers. Also, B2B products can tend to be more complex and larger so there is significant impact on the ROI

- In B2C the customer service team talks to one person who made the transaction whereas B2B there are multiple stakeholders, so if there is any issue then the customer service team might receive calls from different stakeholders from the client side

- B2B customer service team is required to make a bond with the clients to have a deeper understanding of the client’s requirement whereas B2C businesses rarely have a relationship with the clients

Retailers should put themselves in the customer’s shoes to understand their problem which will help them provide the best customer experience. Customer experience keeps the customer loyal and promotes the brand.
