# Pricing

The importance of ecommerce is growing rapidly. Consumers prefer to purchase products online as it can be accessed anywhere at any given point in time. For an ecommerce site to grow it is essential to have a good pricing system in place. When a customer tries to pay online and the transaction fails, most often the customers choose a different payment method whereas, some customers abandon the cart. Those customers who abandon the cart have a negative impact on their ecommerce experience as they find the payment method complicated and confusing. If a business chooses to have only one type of payment method, it will most likely not provide the expected level of customer service. Providing various payment methods will allow potential shoppers to select the payment method which best suits their need which would in turn boost ROI.

## Payment gateways

There are many third-party payment gateways such as Braintree, Stripe, Square etc. who manage the online transaction processing for the business. Typically gift cards are not handled by payment gateway third party.

Businesses can collaborate with the payment gateway teams to manage their transactions.

## Other payment methods

Also, there are various payment methods out there in the market such as:

- Credit and Debit Cards like Mastercard, Visa, American Express
- Electronic Wallets like Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, Afterpay
- Interbank Transfers
- Mobile Payments
- Gift Cards
- Subscriptions

## Online payments

Benefits of online payments include:

- Easy shopping experience for customers
- Swift and hassle-free payment
- Less effort required by the customer
- Multiple payment options increase customer experience
- Secure gatewayâ€”security is a vital point in payments because customers will only proceed to complete their transaction if they feel safe to do so

Given all this, businesses still need to select the payment methods and the payment gateway by analysing aspects like the preference of the customer, setup costs, ongoing costs, security and business requirement. Not one business is the same, each business has a different requirement and is in a different phase - crawl, walk and run. The business requirement and the phase play a major role in the pricing strategy.
