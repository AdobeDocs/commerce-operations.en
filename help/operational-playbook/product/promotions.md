# Promotions

DWith most of the population moving to shop online, retailers need to be one step ahead in providing the best to their customers, retailers need to think what would be the best way to get their products out there in the market? This is where marketing strategy comes into play. In a general aspect, marketing strategy consists of 6 P’s:

- Processes

Each of the six P’s is equally important but to market the products, retailers need to use promotion as a tactic to increase traffic on-site to lead to higher conversion rates. Promotion helps to market the products and services being offered by the brands. There are various promotional levels such as shipping, product and order.
