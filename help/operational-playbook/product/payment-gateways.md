A payment gateway is a form of a service that connects and processes payments for ecommerce websites. Hence, it plays a vital role in the customer buying experience and conversion rates. A complete and complicated payment system has seen to have a negative impact where customers have abandoned the cart. Itâ€™s important to provide them with easy, user-friendly payment system where even if one payment method fails, they have an alternative method to motivate them to complete the purchase.

## Review requirements

Retailers need to select the best payment gateway that meets their requirements. There are many payment gateways in the market like Braintree, Stripe etc. But before the business can decide the payment gateway there are certain questions to be answered such as:

- What is my business requirement?
- Is it within the budget?
- How strong is the security on the payment gateway?
- Will there be any impact on my storefront UX/UI?
- How well does the payment gateway perform?
- How is the support service of the payment gateway once purchased?
- Which payment gateway provider would suit me best?
- Payment gateways assisting other functions such as calculating tax, using geolocations, calculating service fee etc.?

There are some limitations of payment gateways that the retailers need to be aware of such as:

- Not all types of cards are accepted by payment gateways.
- Some payment options might not be available for international shoppers.
- Security loopholes in the payment gateway. Customers do tend to hesitate to place online orders due to security reasons.

When the business decides to integrate the payment gateway with the platform it is always better to see how it would appear on the storefront, what kind of experience will the customers get, and is it user-friendly. Also, check the security of the payment cannot be compromised. A good, secure working payment gateway will boost customer experience.

## B2B and B2C considerations


B2B and B2C have a similar kind of payment system but are more steps involved in a B2B payment as B2B payments have more rules, regulations and processes. B2B businesses tend to deal in larger volumes compared to B2C.

In B2C customers purchase products or services for individual use where customers usually pay the same price as other customers, there is no bargaining involved. Whereas in B2B various
stakeholders are involved which makes it more complex and expensive when it comes to approval.

In B2B customers have different orders and requirements which need to be processed and approved by the sales representative or there needs to a sales representative involvement when the customer purchases online using RFP or Purchase Order.

In B2C payments can be one-time and are of smaller value which is displayed on the storefront, the consumer adds the product to cart and checkout using secure payment where the customer can pay from their choice of payments such as credit card, e-wallet etc.

In B2B due to the high volume the payment for B2B there are different payment options besides the
standard such as checks, bank transfer, purchase orders etc.

Implementing the right payment options is based on the type of business and business requirements.
