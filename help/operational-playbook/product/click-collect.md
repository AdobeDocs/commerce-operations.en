When deciding to implement click and collect, businesses need to consider how they will be delivering click and collect to customers, such as service types:

- **Reserve product online, payment and collection in store**—In this service type the customer does not require to pay online when booking the product. In this type of service, the customer can change their mind and might not purchase the product.

- **Integration**—Once the delivery type is decided, businesses need to decide on integration structure. Where will the orders be sent to, where the orders will be fulfilled. Stock can be fulfilled from either a central warehouse or directly from individual stores

- **Returns**—Returns can be complex hence it is required that businesses need to have a clear strategy to manage returns be it products delivered, or products ordered via click and collect. Businesses need to allow customers to return the products they have orders via click and collect to provide end to end customer service

## Promotion

It is necessary that businesses market their click and collect service. If no one is aware of the service, then it will be so no use and will not generate the required return on investment. Even though click and collect services are usually the same it is still essential to explain to the customer the steps of click and collect.

## Stock availability

Businesses need to display real time stock level to customers when they select click and collect while checking out a product. This will display the stock level to customers in their preferred store. For this to function to work as per requirement it is necessary that the warehouse and the ecommerce platform are integrated to keep the inventory levels in check to avoid customer complaints.

## Fulfillment options

If all the products being sold on the website aren’t available for click and collect, then it is required that businesses display the shipping method provided for the product. This could be a bit inconvenient for customers hence it is a better option to provide maximum products for click and collect.

## Order status

Communication is key for customer service even when it comes to click and collect. Communicating the order status after purchase such as where and when they should collect their order and whether they require to bring any personal identification when coming to collect the order etc. The status should not only be communicated via SMS or email but also on the site under tracking order.

## Additional cost

Some brands charge additional service cost if the order is less than a value for click and collect but research has shown that providing free click and collect increases footfall on the website and increases conversion rate which in turn increases ROI.

## Collection in-store

No matter if the business is B2B or B2C, they all need to provide the best customer service. It is essential to provide in-store information to customers such as where in the shop is the collection point. Designate a well layed out section in the store for click and collect. Ensure customers do not have to wait long to collect their order. Also, some brands also provide click and collect parking, where the user enters the details for click and collect parking and the order is bough out to them by the store employees.
