# Shipping and fulfillment

A lot of effort goes into providing customers with the best online experience from content to products to blog to check out and so on. But on the physical side of things, retailers should not overlook the importance of shipping. Shipping cannot just be handed over to any third party, there needs to be research, planning, and analysing involved. This is the final point in the customer experience journey, this is the reason why shipping and fulfilment should be mapped out in the right manner.

## Basic factors

Shipping and fulfilment have some basic factors that act as the foundation such as:

- **Shipping methods and cost**—Businesses need to analyse and divide whether the entire cost of shipping will be passed onto the customer or onto the business or will it be split? How will the business provide free shipping or shipping offers? How will the products be shipped? Will there be more than one shipping method and shipping costs?

- **Product**—Each product would be different from each other in terms of the number of items, weight, destination, durability etc. Businesses need to analyse such details to understand the total cost of shipping as different products have different shipping costs

- **Packaging**—Packaging also plays an important role in understanding the shipping method and cost. For example, is the product fragile, or is it packed as a gift?

- **Season**—What changes should be brought in during peak seasons like click frenzy, festivals, etc.

- **Carriers**—Which third-party shipping company would best suit the business? What are the services provided by the shipping companies? What is the cost?

## Shipping methods

Before a business ships their product, the company would need to decide the shipping methods and costs. There are various options for shipping methods such as:

- **Free shipping**—Providing free shipping to customers might be the best customer experience but might not suit the business as in the end someone has to pay so if not the customer then the cost would be on the business/retailer

- **Real-time rates**—Collaborating with third-party shipping providers would allow retailers to post the shipping method and cost as per the shipping company currently. This allows customers to choose their preferred shipping method

- **Flat rate**—One of the most popular shipping options. But the trick here is to ensure that retailers do not overcharge or undercharge the customers. This also works if the retailers have a standard product but can get complicated if the retailers have a variety of products.

- **Free shipping over an amount**—Retailers can provide free shipping when the customer purchases above a certain amount. Retailers would need to calculate that amount to provide this service

Shipping and fulfilment require team coordination both internally and externally. Shipping and fulfilment strategy should be shared with the entire organisation so that they are aligned. For example, if the marketing team wants to send out a promotion where free shipping is applied, they would need to align it with the shipping and fulfilment strategy and team to eliminate any negative customer experience.

## Best practices

There are some  ecommerce best practises that be leveraged by retailers when deciding the shipping and fulfilment strategy such as:

- The right team with the right people who have the skills required
- Setting goals for the teams to follow
- Selecting the correct shipping strategy which best suits the business
- Reviewing the strategy and reiterating as and when required
