# Order management systems

Online shopping is increasing as a rapid rate and companies are competing to provide the best service to attract customers to their site. To have competitive advantage retailers need to grow their digital footprint this includes selling online, other marketplaces, and even partnerships.

Ecommerce order management system is the back-end process of managing and meeting orders placed online. This involves things like packaging, shipping, returns and subscriptions. An order management system in today’s time need to allow the retailers to be one step ahead of their competitors, to be more scalable, flexible and adaptable. The OMS should allow the business to meet the customer demands and easily change with the market.

Order management systems allow integration and automation through the customer order journey in the back end, this allows retailers to provide enhanced customer experience. OMS help retailers to process orders coming in from multiple channels and facilitating the packing and shipping to different locations while proving update to the customer via different mediums in real-time.

Order Management System is important for an  ecommerce site as it helps brands to grow and since customers have a high expectation in terms of maximising customer experience which leaves no room for error. Some of the reasons why an OMS system is essential:

- **Provides faster delivery**—In an age of next day or 2-day shipping, businesses need to look out for ways to push their orders out fast as the windows of completing orders are becoming narrower. An OMS gets immediately notified when an order is placed, and the OMS can choose the nearest warehouse to the order destination to help fast track the delivery. OMS send automated order information for the warehouse team to prepare and pack the order to ship is using a cost-effective shipping method

- **Limited errors**: OMS help to cut down on human errors. These errors can be time-consuming and expensive at times. OMS help to notify the team when the inventory levels are low, or when a product is not selling or what product has the highest return rate. This helps the business to rectify the errors, analyse the reason for returns, shipping errors etc. to improve customer experience

- **Increase in scalability**—OMS system scales according to the need of the business, unlike the old manual systems. OMS software gives the business the option to scale with the market to not fall back

- **More multi-channel possibilities**—In the era of multi-channel sales across websites, marketplaces or partnerships like Facebook, Instagram. Tracking orders can be complex as they are being shipped to several locations, through one or more shipping methods, OMS help to bring it together and increase customer experience

Businesses/retailers would need to select the appropriate OMS system that best suits their business needs to utilise the OMS system, efficiently. Businesses should start with:

- Understanding their customer orders, products, inventory, shipping and packing

- They need to decide how and when will the OMS system communicate with the company system during the order process

- What should the OMS system do when the order has been placed, should it communicate with the company systems, if so then which systems? and once they communicate what should be the next step

- Based on the order the OMS will send the information to the warehouse. Businesses need to decide which tasks in the warehouse would be automated such as calculating shipping costs, allocating the shipping method, packing slips, and/or updating inventory

- If a product is out of stock should the OMS system communicate it to the vendors, production team, suppliers etc to restock the product

- For shipping should the OMS system notify the customer about the progress of their order and notify the team.

- If a product is returned what should the process be for the OMS like automate the refund, update inventory, send the information to the customer and team

- Cost of the OMS - if the business can afford a full-fledged OMS system or parts of it

- Implementing the OMS system - this would be a project to implement the OMS system and train the team to best utilise it

Businesses need to go through different aspects to better understand the OMS whether the organisation has an existing OMS or are looking to set one up. But in the long run, an OMS system can help control costs, increase ROI, speed up the process and improve not only the customer but team experience. To summarise:

Order Management in B2B is intricate compared to B2C. B2B usually has a higher cost when it comes to retaining customers as they have a different purchase cycle compared to B2C. B2B purchase cycle takes longer as it involves RFP’s, Purchase Order etc. B2B orders tend to be reorders several times where as B2C tends to have orders that are high in volume and smaller in size.

## Process for B2B

- The sales representative enters the customer’s order details into the OMS or the customer can also place an order online which will send the order details to the OMS

- The customer receives the order confirmation

- Products are allocated to the order

- The order details are sent to the warehouse where the products are packed

- The inventory is updated

- Order status is sent to the customer

- Order is shipped to the customer

Order management can be effective for B2B and B2C businesses where the OMS system:

- Allows omnichannel or multichannel adoption which helps order management

- OMS is usually cloud-based which allows organisations to go paperless which helps to improve overall efficiency

- Helps to centralise information from multiple channels

- Reduces complexity once it has been implemented

- Helps to track orders

- Improved customer experience

- Helps speed up the delivery process

When implementing an OMS system B2B business needs to understand that they will not be able to serve customers such as B2C businesses. OMS need to be implemented differently for both B2B and B2C depending on their requirement.
