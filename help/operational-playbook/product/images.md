Many factors play a role in increasing ROI, once such a factor is the product image. Product images play a major role in attracting and convincing the customer as to why they should purchase the product. Products images can be used in an identical way for both B2B and B2C.

In real life, customers can feel and try the product but when purchasing online they do not have an option to do so, thus it is necessary to provide detailed information about the product. Along with details, it is essential to have high-quality visuals of the product like images and videos, this will help the customer understand the product before they decide to purchase. Product images are the first thing that the customer sees on the website, even before the product description, name or price.

- **Simple content**—do not over complicate the content. Try to keep the content simple and attractive where the focus is the product e.g., one best practice is to have the product image o a white background which enhances the product image.

It is important to be transparent with the customer otherwise there could be a high rate of returns is placed

Retailers need to remember that the goal of product images is to show the customer what product it is, how it looks and motivate them to buy it.
