# Dynamic pricing management

Dynamic pricing is a responsive pricing strategy where the price changes based on the demand, supply, trend and competition in real-time. It is not a new concept; it has been around for a while now but is surely taking over ecommerce. Dynamic pricing gives retailers the leverage to change prices to have a competitive advantage. Like retailers can decrease the price of a product that does not sell to well to increase the sales.

Overall, it can be said there are 3 factors that drive dynamic pricing:

- **Industry**—Retailers need to check what is the most basic price of a product among other brands.

- **Market**—What is the demand and supply currently, what is the predicted demand and supply?

- **Customers**—What is the customer purchasing behaviour? What is the price the customer would be willing to spend on the product.

Retailers would need to look at every aspect when working on a dynamic pricing strategy.

## Benefits

Like any other strategy, dynamic pricing also has benefits and pitfalls. Some of the benefits of applying a dynamic pricing strategy are:

- Allows retailers to gain insights on customer purchasing behaviour and market trends

- Retailers can set different product prices based on the most basic price set for the product by other brands

- Allows retailers to analyse what price would be most acceptable for the customer to spend

- Helps to maximise ROI

- Provides retailers with a competitive advantage

## Pitfalls

Some of the pitfalls of dynamic pricing are:

- Not regularly updating the price. Even though the software would be managing, it is essential that human interaction is available constantly

- Fluctuating prices to often will confuse the customers, some customers might wait for the prices to change again or some customers might lose trust

- Competition with other brands might increase initially when the strategy is applied

## Best practices

Some best practices that can be applied when implementing dynamic pricing strategy:

- Set a good pricing strategy which is more initial pricing based. Initial pricing is straightforward, and it helps retailers understand the market and the market pricing

- Introducing a loyalty program can help to introduce different dynamic pricing level for different types of customers

- Analyse real-time demand for products when setting prices

- Apply a holistic approach when implementing dynamic pricing because a product can be of different prices in different stores. E.g., a Hot Dog in IKEA costs cheaper than buying a pack of buns at the supermarket

The most effective way to gain benefit from implementing dynamic pricing is continuously learning about the customers, competitors, and market

## B2B vs B2C

Dynamic pricing differs between B2B and B2C:

### B2B should

- Provide customised pricing for customers

- Automatic change in price based on the quantity

### B2C should

- Maintain consistency

- Maintain price

- Display promotions and discounts

- Terms and Conditions to be displayed
