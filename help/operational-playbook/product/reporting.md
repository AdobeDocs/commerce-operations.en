Every business has a different requirement and dashboards can be meet those requirements. For example, if the brand wants to track a specific promotion, they can create a specific dashboard to see the progress of the promotion such as how many people used the promotions, which products sold the best, etc. They can also use the dashboard to track daily activities on the site, traffic, conversion rate, bestselling product, worst-selling product, returns etc.

## Features

Some other features of reports and dashboards:

- Tracks ROI which helps retailers to make decisions and monitor their progress

- Track Sales to understand what on their site is generating the most sales

- Traffic on the site can be tracked in real-time to visualise the information

- Able to measure the success of the features on the site and to improve them to enhance customer service

- Monitoring KPIs of each team

There is so much going on in an ecommerce business, it can get difficult for the retailers to keep track and that’s where reports and dashboard come to play. They consolidate all the data in one place to give an overview of the business to everyone. Helps retailers to set new targets, identify new opportunities and get a competitive advantage.

## B2B options

Top 4 reports and dashboards that can be used by B2B companies are:

- **Company profile**—B2B businesses need to track the company profiles of their clients to understand their purchase history like what products they purchased, the payment details, which channel they used to purchase and so on. This dashboard can help to identify any potential risks or issues.

- **Catalogue**—A catalogue report and dashboard can help a B2B business to view the performance of each product in the catalogue, promotions, inventory levels etc which can help them identify what kind of promotion best worked and which product is in demand. This will help them be one step ahead in terms of stocking up the inventory and give them a competitive advantage

- **Quotes**—B2B model works on quotes and pricing where the B2B business needs to go through a process where they analyse the quote sent by the client with the pricing so that they can either approve or negotiate. A quote report and dashboard will help them improve their quote conversion rate by tracking the success rate, competition rates, performance and overall customer retention

- **Sales**—Even though B2B business can work online but there is still a need for a sale representative to get things moving along in terms of identifying quotes that need negotiation, track quotes which are getting expired, contracts which are up for renewal, track team performance and help to streamline their day-to-day business activities.

## Better together

If a merchant is using MBI and Adobe Analytics and is looking for a way to correlate behavioral data to transactional commerce data so they can gain a more accurate understanding of how marketing activities impact core commerce metrics.
