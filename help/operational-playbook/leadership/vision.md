# Vision

An organisation's vision is the desired state, or ultimate condition that the organisation is working to achieve. It is typically expressed in a vision statement, which is a clear and brief summary of what the organisation is trying to achieve. 

An organisational vision provides focus and serves as a source of inspiration for employees. It articulates the goals for theâ€‹ organisation, and it is important for all employees to understand and work towards the same vision across the organisation.
