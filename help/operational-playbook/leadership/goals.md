# Goals

Organisational goals are strategically set objectives that outline expected results and guide the efforts of employees to share objectives. Goals are critical to organisational effectiveness, as they serve as an objective for people to work towards. Itâ€™s important to establish short-term as well aslong-term goals for your business, in order to provide realistic steppingstones towards achieving  long-term objectives.

## Short-term goals

Short-term goals are often defined as having a time frame under five years, and more  commonly, within one to three years. These goals have an operational component to them, with action plans for the immediate future. They also roll up to form the action plan for achieving long-term goals.

## Long-term goals

Long-term goals are commonly defined as goals that will take a minimum of five to ten years to achieve. Long-term goals are inherently strategic and are used to shape the overall direction of an organisation. These goals form the broad strategy which maps out the long- term direction for the organisation. Long-term goals should have periodic milestones or benchmarks for the organisation to use in evaluating their progress.
