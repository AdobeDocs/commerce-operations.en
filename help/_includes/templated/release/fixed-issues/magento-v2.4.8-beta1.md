## Fixed issues

We have fixed 253 issues in the Magento Open Source 2.4.8 core code. A subset of the fixed issues included in this release is described below.

### APIs

* _AC-10042_: /V1/transactions REST API returns error when parent_txn_id = txn_id
  * _Fix note_: The system now correctly handles the parent and child concept transactions where the parent transaction ID is the same as the transaction ID, preventing an infinite loop when querying the /V1/transactions REST API endpoint. Previously, this scenario would result in a fatal error due to maximum execution time being exceeded.
  * _GitHub code contribution_: <https://github.com/magento/magento2/commit/1bafc571>
* _AC-11878_: [Graphql] Type issue in 2.4.7
  * _Fix note_: The system now correctly handles integer values in the GetCustomSelectedOptionAttributes function when executing a GraphQL query, preventing any type-related errors. Previously, launching a GraphQL query that used GetCustomSelectedOptionAttributes with an integer argument resulted in a type error.
  * _GitHub issue_: <https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/38662>
  * _GitHub code contribution_: <https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/38663>
* _ACP2E-2927_: [REST API]: Use Default value in store view does not stay checked after adding configurations for a configurable product
  * _Fix note_: The issue has been fixed by ensuring correct database entries for the customizable options for a non-default store. The checkbox for the custom store in the "admin > Catalogue > Product Edit > Customizable Options" section was previously unchecked owing to inaccurate database entries, even if the option title for the custom store stayed the same as the default store.
  * _GitHub code contribution_: <https://github.com/magento/magento2/commit/3056e9cb>
* _ACP2E-2969_: REST API unable to make requests with slash (/) in SKU when using Oauth1
  * _Fix note_: Prior to the fix, you were not able to make a successful API call for a product that had "/" in its SKU. Now, you can issue a successful API get request for product details even though its SKU has a forward slash in it.
  * _GitHub code contribution_: <https://github.com/magento/magento2/commit/b21e5d91>
* _ACP2E-3079_: Customer address update failing when updating through REST API if "validateDefaultAddress" enabled

  * _GitHub code contribution_: <https://github.com/magento/magento2/commit/9af794a4>
* _ACP2E-3091_: [Cloud] Creating the Duplicate website group price customer group in Tier Prices Api.

Previously it was possible to create the Duplicate website group price customer group in Tier Prices Api that would not pass validation in Admin during product save.
  * _GitHub code contribution_: <https://github.com/magento/magento2/commit/148c3ead>
* _ACP2E-3130_: Can't add order comment with status via REST API
  * _Fix note_: The issue has been resolved by allowing the change in order status if it is from the current state only. Previously, it was not honouring the order state and preventing changes in any order status, even if it was from the same state.
  * _GitHub code contribution_: <https://github.com/magento/magento2/commit/93d50f8d>

### Account

* _AC-10782_: Customer address form allows random code in the name fields
  * _Fix note_: The system now validates the input in the First Name and Last Name fields in the customer address form, preventing the use of random code. Previously, the system allowed the use of random code in these fields without throwing an error.

  * _GitHub code contribution_: <https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/38345>
* _AC-10990_: my account add address crash on save

  * _GitHub code contribution_: <https://github.com/magento/magento2/commit/44cef3a9>

### Admin UI

* _AC-11588_: Data validation is success and Import button is present during Import products with Replace behavior
  * _Fix note_: The system now correctly validates data and hides the "Import" button during the product import process with "Replace" behavior, preventing any unintended data replacement. Previously, the system incorrectly validated the data and displayed the "Import" button, leading to potential data inconsistencies.
  * _GitHub code contribution_: <https://github.com/magento/magento2/commit/0574ac23>
* _AC-12167_: [Bug] Magento 2.4.7 doesn't allow product photo's with capital letter file extension.

  * _Fix note_: The system now automatically removes unused changelog tables when an index is switched from 'update on schedule' to 'update on save', marking the index as invalid to ensure no entries are missed. Previously, switching an index to 'update on save' would leave unused changelog tables in the system and mark all changed indexes as 'valid'.
  * _GitHub issue_: <https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/29789>
  * _GitHub code contribution_: <https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/25859>
* _AC-9843_: i18n:collect-phrases breaks the translations integrity
  * _Fix note_: The `bin/magento i18n:collect-phrases -o` command  now correctly collects and adds new phrases from JavaScript and .phtml files, ensuring that translations are accurately reflected in the translation file. Previously, the system failed to include multiline translation phrases from JavaScript files and phrases from .phtml files in the translation file, leading to incomplete or incorrect translations.
  * _GitHub code contribution_: <https://github.com/magento/magento2/commit/0c53bbf7>
* _ACP2E-2787_: Apostrophe in store view name is replaced by &#039;

  * _Fix note_: Previously, before the fix, the related products were reset and became empty when the secondary admin user clicked on the save button without changing in related product. After this fix, the secondary admin user clicks on the save button and the product doesn't reset and is saved successfully.
  * _GitHub code contribution_: <https://github.com/magento/magento2/commit/3056e9cb>
* _ACP2E-3033_: Unable to export more than 200 orders
  * _Fix note_: The server limits for the request size of previously submitted selected IDs have been neglected by altering the HTTP request from GET to POST in order to fix the issue. Previously, due to the server limitations for GET request size, the issue was encountered.
  * _GitHub code contribution_: <https://github.com/magento/magento2/commit/93d50f8d>
* _ACP2E-3037_: Checkout page Validation message incorrect.
  * _Fix note_: If any required field is left empty, such as "address," the server-side validation will not display the message.

Previously, the message "address is required" would appear if any required field was left empty, in addition to the client-side validation message.
  * _GitHub code contribution_: <https://github.com/magento/magento2/commit/9af794a4>
* _ACP2E-3125_: Password reset template issue with Admin user

### Catalog, Framework

* _ACP2E-2949_: [Cloud]Follow-up: Mismatch in Data Comparison when checking if data has changes
  * _Fix note_: Previously, the save object was called every time without any data changes (for any numeric data field - like int/float/double). It triggers the flag _hasDataChanges to be true and calls the save function. It also does not check the floating numbers encapsulated by string. After this fix applies, the save function will call only if the data is changed. The data value for int/float/double-check with the value passing to the function and does strict type matching
