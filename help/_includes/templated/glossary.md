(The term "root category"  may be confusing, because the "root category" isn't really a category at all, but a container for the menu, which consists of categories and subcategories.)

### configurable product

_noun_

A configurable product looks like a single product with drop-down lists of options for each variation.
Each option is actually a separate simple product with a unique SKU, which makes it possible to track inventory for each product variation.
To achieve a similar effect, a simple product can be used with custom options, but without the ability to track inventory for each variation.
Products with multiple options are sometimes referred to as composite products.

Although a configurable product uses more SKUs, and may initially take a little longer to set up, it can save you time in the end.
If you plan to grow your business, the configurable product type might be a better choice for a product with multiple options.

Example: T-shirts that are available in two colors and three sizes.
Six variants must be created as individual products (each with its own SKU).
Then, all variants are added to a configurable product where customers can choose the size and color, and then add it to their cart.

UPWARD is an acronym for Unified Progressive Web App Response Definition.
An UPWARD definition file describes how a web server delivers and supports a Progressive Web Application.

UPWARD definition files provide details about server behavior using platform-independent, declarative language.
This allows a Progressive Web Application to run on top of an UPWARD-compliant server in any language on any tech stack because the application is only concerned about the HTTP endpoint behavior from the UPWARD server.

An UPWARD server uses a definition file to determine the appropriate process or service for a request from an application shell.
It describes how the server should handle a request and build the response for it.

A PWA project can include an UPWARD definition file to specify its service dependencies.
