# MariaDB configuration settings

Reindexing on MariaDB 10.4 and 10.6 takes more time compared to previous MariaDB or MySQL versions. To speed up reindexing, we recommend setting these MariaDB configuration parameters:

*  [`optimizer_switch='rowid_filter=off'`](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/optimizer-switch/)
*  [`optimizer_use_condition_selectivity = 1`](https://mariadb.com/products/skysql/docs/reference/es/system-variables/optimizer_use_condition_selectivity/)

If you experience performance degradation not related to indexation after upgrading to MariaDB 10.6, consider enabling the [`--query-cache-type`](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/server-system-variables/#query_cache_type) setting. For example, `--query-cache-type=ON`.

Before upgrading Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure projects, you may also need to upgrade MariaDB ([see MariaDB upgrade best practices](../implementation-playbook/best-practices/maintenance/mariadb-upgrade.md)).

For example:

*  Adobe Commerce 2.4.6 with MariaDB version 10.5.1 or higher
*  Adobe Commerce 2.3.5 with MariaDB version 10.3 or earlier

In addition to these recommendations, you should consult with your database administrator on configuring the following parameters:

*  [`--query-cache-limit`](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/server-system-variables/#query_cache_limit)
*  [`--query-cache-size`](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/server-system-variables/#query_cache_size)
*  [`--join-buffer-size`](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/server-system-variables/#join_buffer_size)
*  [`--innodb-buffer-pool-size`](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/innodb-buffer-pool/#innodb_buffer_pool_size)
