# The [!UICONTROL Deploy] tab

This tab is an attempt to isolate issues and causes of deployment problems quickly.

## [!UICONTROL Deploy log Deployment Troubleshooter]

![Deploy log Deployment Troubleshooter](../../assets/tools/observation-for-adobe-commerce/deploy-tab-1.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL Deploy log Deployment Troubleshooter]** frame shows a count of deploy log events that occurred across the selected timeframe. The intent is to provide an at-a-glance view of deployment activity and determine the complexity of the deployment by the count. The more logged messages, the more complex the deployment typically is.

## [!UICONTROL Deploy State]
