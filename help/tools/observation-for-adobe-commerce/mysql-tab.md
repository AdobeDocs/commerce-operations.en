# The [!UICONTROL MySQL] tab

## [!UICONTROL MySQL% free storage by node]

![MySQL% free storage by node](../../assets/tools/observation-for-adobe-commerce/mysql-tab-1.jpg)

Many problems are caused by MySQL running out of storage in the storage assigned to MySQL (`datadir` MySQL configuration setting, default is `/data/mysql`) or the `tmpdir` running out of space. The default `tmpdir` (MySQL setting) is `/tmp`. The **[!UICONTROL MySQL% free storage by node]** frame looks at the `/, /tmp` (if defined as a separate mount) and the `/data/mysql` percentage of free storage. Starting in MySQL version 5.7 (MariaDB version 10.2), uncompressed `tmp` tables are written to a `tmp` tablespace in the `/data/mysql` directory in the file (ibtmp1). This file automatically expands without limit by default. As it is a tablespace, it will not decrease in size and will reset to 12MB when MySQL restarts.

## [!UICONTROL MySQL Connections by Node]

![MySQL Connections by Node](../../assets/tools/observation-for-adobe-commerce/mysql-tab-2.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL MySQL Connections by Node]** frame indicates periods of database node outages or high volumes of connections.

## [!UICONTROL MySQL Node Summary]

![MySQL Node Summary](../../assets/tools/observation-for-adobe-commerce/mysql-tab-3.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL MySQL Node Summary]** table shows database node details such as software version and instance type (size).

## [!UICONTROL Galera Number of Nodes in cluster]

![Galera Number of Nodes in cluster](../../assets/tools/observation-for-adobe-commerce/mysql-tab-4.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL Galera Number of Nodes in cluster]** frame displays information from the MySQL logs. As nodes join and leave a cluster, only the messages for the selected timeframe will be shown. If a node leaves the cluster before the timeframe, no message will exist during that timeframe. If you suspect that the database may be running short of a node, expand the timeframe to a larger period to see if you can see additional information. If there is information during the time period that indicates less than all nodes in the [!DNL Galera] cluster, expand the timeframe to see if you can determine when the node left the cluster.

## [!UICONTROL MySQL shutdowns and starts]

![MySQL shutdowns and starts](../../assets/tools/observation-for-adobe-commerce/mysql-tab-5.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL MySQL shutdowns and starts]** frame detects when there is a shutdown of a node. The [!DNL Galera] nodes will be evicted and will self-evict from the [!DNL Galera] node. This will typically result in a restart of the MySQL service.

## [!UICONTROL Galera log]

![Galera log](../../assets/tools/observation-for-adobe-commerce/mysql-tab-6.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL Galera log]** frame shows the counts of particular signals from the MySQL logs concerning [!DNL Galera] nodes, their states, and the state changes of the [!DNL Galera] cluster.

* '%1047 WSREP has not yet prepared node for application use%') as 'node_not_prep_for_use'
* '%\[ERROR\] WSREP: Failed to read from: wsrep_sst_xtrabackup-v2%') as 'xtrabackup_read_fail'
* '%\[ERROR\] WSREP: Process completed with error: wsrep_sst_xtrabackup-v2 %') as 'xtrabackup_compl_w_err'
* '%\[ERROR\] WSREP: rbr write fail%') as 'rbr_write_fail'
* '%self-leave%') as 'susp_node'
* '%members = 3/3 (joined/total)%') as'3of3'
* '%members = 2/3 (joined/total)%') as'2of3'
* '%members = 2/2%') as '2of2'
* '%members = 1/2%') as '1of2'
* '%members = 1/3%') as '1of3'
* '%members = 1/1%') as '1of1'
* '%\[Note\] /usr/sbin/mysqld (mysqld 10.%') as'sql_restart'
* '%Quorum: No node with complete state:%') as 'no_node_count'
* '%WSREP: Member 0%') as 'mem_0'
* '%WSREP: Member 1.0%') as 'mem_1'
* '%WSREP: Member 2%') as'mem2'
* '%WSREP: Synchronized with group, ready for connections%') as 'ready'
* '%/usr/sbin/mysqld, Version:%') as 'mysql_restart_mysql.slow'
* '%\[Note\] WSREP: New cluster view: global state:%') as 'galera_cluster_view_chng'

## [!UICONTROL Galera Log by Host]

![Galera Log by Host](../../assets/tools/observation-for-adobe-commerce/mysql-tab-7.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL Galera Log by Host]** frame is the same as the **[!UICONTROL Galera log]** frame, except that it is broken out by node to help with troubleshooting. 

## [!UICONTROL Database performance]

![Database performance](../../assets/tools/observation-for-adobe-commerce/mysql-tab-8.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL Database performance]** frame shows database performance during specific requests. You can see each metric by clicking on them in the colored icons below the graph. Many of the metrics called out in [Monitoring MySQL Database Performance with New Relic](https://newrelic.com/blog/how-to-relic/how-to-monitor-mysql) are found in this frame.

* average(query.queriesPerSecond)
* average(query.slowQueriesPerSecond)
* average(db.createdTmpDiskTablesPerSecond)
* average(db.createdTmpFilesPerSecond)
* average(db.tablesLocksWaitedPerSecond)
* average(db.innodb.rowLockTimeAvg)
* average(db.innodb.rowLockWaitsPerSecond)

## [!UICONTROL Transaction Database Call Count]

![Transaction Database Call Count](../../assets/tools/observation-for-adobe-commerce/mysql-tab-9.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL Transaction Database Call Count]** frame shows the number of database calls made by each transaction facet. This seems to be row-focused and not statements.

## [!UICONTROL Cron_schedule table updates]

![Cron_schedule table updates](../../assets/tools/observation-for-adobe-commerce/mysql-tab-10.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL Cron_schedule table updates]** frame displays the maximum duration of database updates to the cron_schedule table for the selected time period.

## [!UICONTROL Slow Query Traces]

![Slow Query Traces](../../assets/tools/observation-for-adobe-commerce/mysql-tab-11.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL Slow Query Traces]** frame displays the table and request type where slow query traces exist. A slow query trace is created for query transactions that take longer than five seconds. Of importance for this frame are the update queries. If a table is being updated by `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `INSERT` statements, they may lock tables for a period of time.

Even `SELECT` statements may lock rows if used with FOR UPDATE.

## [!UICONTROL Datastore Operations tables]

![Datastore Operations tables](../../assets/tools/observation-for-adobe-commerce/mysql-tab-12.jpg)

## [!UICONTROL Cron table change]

![Cron table change](../../assets/tools/observation-for-adobe-commerce/mysql-tab-13.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL Cron table change]** frame looks for "could not acquire lock for cron job:" error messages, along with a specific PHP memory error and locks involving the `cron_schedule` table. If the `cron_schedule` table is locked (for example, by a `DELETE` query being run against it), it will block other crons from running.

## [!UICONTROL Deadlocks]

![Deadlocks](../../assets/tools/observation-for-adobe-commerce/mysql-tab-14.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL Deadlocks]** frame looks at the following strings parsed from the MySQL logs:

* '%PHP Fatal error: Allowed memory size of%') as php_mem_error
* '%get lock; try restarting transaction, query was: DELETE FROM \`cron_schedule%') as cron_sched_lock_del
* '% lock for cron job: indexer_reindex_all_invalid%') as 'lock_indexer_reindex_all_invalid%'
