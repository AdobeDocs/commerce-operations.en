# The [!UICONTROL Summary] tab

The [!UICONTROL Summary] tab of [!DNL Observation for Adobe Commerce] is intended to quickly see some of the problems experienced by sites to help you auto-resolve or identify potential root causes of site problems. The additional tabs provide deeper level information on component services, database, infrastructure, and process states.

## [!UICONTROL Transaction Overview]

![Transaction Overview](../../assets/tools/transaction-overview.jpg)

### [What is a transaction?](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm/#:%7E:text=transactions%20are%20reported.-,What%20is%20a%20transaction%3F,work%20in%20a%20software%20application.&text=For%20APM%2C%20it%20will%20often,when%20the%20response%20is%20sent)

"At [!DNL New Relic], a transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in a software application. Specifically, it refers to the function calls and method calls that make up that unit of work. It often refers to a web transaction, which represents an activity that happens from when the application receives a web request to when the response is sent."

### Types of transactions:

**Web:** Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor.

**Non-web:** Non-web transactions are not initiated with a web request. They can include non-web worker processes, background processes, scripts, message queue activity, and other tasks.

If you look at the **[!UICONTROL Transaction Overview]** frame above, there were almost 53,000 transactions with an average APDEX score of .76, and 95% of those transactions happened in under 2.313 seconds. This would be a frame where a tighter timeframe may show deviation from that current average if there is an APDEX hit during a short timeframe.

## [!UICONTROL 404 page errors frame]

![404 page errors frame](../../assets/tools/404-page-errors.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL 404 page errors]** frame lists the [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) and the count of 404 page errors for a selected timeframe.

## [!UICONTROL % of Storage Free frame]

![percent of Storage Free frame](../../assets/tools/percent-of-storage-free.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL % of Storage Free]** frame displays the average percent free of the storage mounts across all the nodes of your cluster. For example, if you have a three node cluster, the frame shows the \<mount point\>, \<environment name\>. This frame can be deceptive if there is a variance across three nodes. An example of a variance would be if the `/data/mysql` mount point free was a different value across the three node cluster. There is a frame under the [!UICONTROL MySQL] tab that facets the mount points by node name to see more accurately what the `/data/mysql` storage free on each node actually is.

## [!UICONTROL % of system memory that is free frame]

![percent of system memory that is free frame](../../assets/tools/percent-of-system-memory-that-is-free.jpg)

The **% of system memory that is free** frame displays, by node, the amount of system memory that is free on each node.

## [!UICONTROL Swap memory free in bytes]

![swap memory free in bytes](../../assets/tools/swap-memory-free-in-bytes.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL Swap memory free in bytes]** frame displays, by node, the amount of SWAP memory that is free on the node.

## [!UICONTROL CPU % by host]

![CPU percent by host](../../assets/tools/cpu-percent-by-host.jpg)

The aggregate of all environments and nodes is displayed in the **[!UICONTROL CPU % by host]** frame. You should deselect the non-production environments. Also note any instances where all nodes for the production environment are not present. For more tips on high CPU utilization, refer to [Troubleshoot performance using New Relic on Adobe Commerce](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-knowledge-base/kb/troubleshooting/miscellaneous/troubleshoot-performance-using-new-relic-on-magento-commerce.html).

## [!UICONTROL Alerts during timeframe]

![alerts during timeframe](../../assets/tools/alerts-during-timeframe.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL Alerts during timeframe]** displays all alerts, including the [!UICONTROL Managed Alerts] added by Adobe Commerce support.

## [!UICONTROL CPU Usage]

![CPU usage](../../assets/tools/cpu-usage.jpg)

If the **[!UICONTROL CPU Usage]** frame is blank, it is an indication that the infrastructure application of [!DNL New Relic] is not enabled. If your site is on Starter, you do not see this information. If your site is on Pro, open a [support ticket](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-knowledge-base/kb/help-center-guide/magento-help-center-user-guide.html) to have [!DNL New Relic Infrastructure] enabled for your site.

## [!UICONTROL Average Response Time]

![average response time](../../assets/tools/average-response-time.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL Average Response Time]** graph shows the average response time for transactions (web and others).

## [!UICONTROL Long duration cron_schedule updates]

![long duration cron_schedule updates](../../assets/tools/long-duration-cron-schedule-updates.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL cron_schedule]** table is written at the start and finish of cron jobs. Long duration cron jobs could indicate latency in updating this table, which can indicate cron stackup or an issue with how crons are scheduled.

## [!UICONTROL Response Code]

![response code](../../assets/tools/response-code.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL Response Code]** frame is a good indication of web traffic and the response code of requests. It is [!DNL New Relic's] transaction data, and it is faceted by the `httpResponseCode` returned.

## [!UICONTROL Web Traffic volume compared with one week ago Magento Managed Alerts Information]

![web traffic volume compared with one week ago](../../assets/tools/web-traffic-volume-compared.jpg)

This frame displays the comparative web traffic volume of the past one week and the current week.

## [!UICONTROL Deployment Log Entries]

![deployment log entries](../../assets/tools/deployment-log-entries.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL Deployment Log Entries]** frame displays a count of deployment and cloud log entries and facets the counts by the deployment log name.

## [!UICONTROL Deployment State]

![deployment state](../../assets/tools/deployment-state.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL Deployment State]** frame facets particular deployment phases from the deploy logs. Here are some examples of phases counted in the log and the facet name: 

**Deployment Log Phases:**

* '%Starting generate command%') as 'start_gen'

* '%deploy-complete%') as 'cl_deploy_compl'

## [!UICONTROL IP Frequency]

![IP frequency](../../assets/tools/ip-frequency.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL IP Frequency]** frame counts the ('MISS' and 'PASS') statuses for each IP from the [!DNL Fastly] logs. Web requests with these statuses reach the origin server and will add load to the server. It shows the top twenty addresses in frequency. This frame can be used to detect IP attacks or sources of heavy load on a website.

## [!UICONTROL IP Response – top 20 URLs in duration]

![ip response – top 20 urls in duration](../../assets/tools/ip-response-top-20-urls.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL IP Response – top 20 URLs in duration]** frame displays the URLs with the longest duration in response. It may indicate large image files or pages, API or pages with the longest response duration.

## [!UICONTROL API Calls by IP]

![api calls by ip](../../assets/tools/api-calls-by-ip.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL API Calls by IP]** frame helps identify heavy traffic against the APIs and the IP addresses making requests from the API URLs.

## [!UICONTROL API Calls by IP, details by URL]

![api calls by ip details by url](../../assets/tools/api-calls-by-ip-details-by-url.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL API Calls by IP, details by URL]** frame provides details of heavy traffic against the APIs and details of the URLs making the requests.

## [!UICONTROL IP Frequency Rate per minute]

![ip frequency rate per minute](../../assets/tools/ip-frequency-rate-per-minute.jpg)

Sometimes it is hard to tell which IP address has the most requests on the other frames. The **[!UICONTROL IP Frequency Rate per minute]** frame shows the rate per minute per IP address.

## [!UICONTROL Potential Bots]

![potential bots](../../assets/tools/potential-bots.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL Potential Bots]** frame looks at requests with a request_user_agent name like NULL or '%bot%'. Typically, the '%bot%' request_user_agent follows the policy setup in `robots.txt` file.

## [!UICONTROL Transaction Errors]

![transaction errors](../../assets/tools/transaction-errors.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL Transaction Errors]** frame displays the count of transaction errors from [!DNL New Relic].

## [!UICONTROL Nginx access by node]

![nginx access by node](../../assets/tools/nginx-access-by-node.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL Nginx access by node]** frame looks at counts from the `access.log` by node. It is helpful to see if the load is evenly distributed. It often shows when a node drops. The frame also shows the load across the site.

## [!UICONTROL Galera Log]

![galera log](../../assets/tools/galera-log.jpg)

[[!DNL Galera]](https://galeracluster.com/library/galera-documentation.pdf) is used for the database cluster. This frame is focused on particular signals from the [!UICONTROL Galera] cluster. The signals focus on nodes entering and exiting the cluster, which is normal behavior to maintain database data integrity. The nodes are kept synchronized as the [!UICONTROL Galera] cluster state changes.

**List of [!UICONTROL Galera] state changes:**

* '%1047 WSREP has not yet prepared node for application use%') as 'node_not_prep_for_use'
* '%\[ERROR\] WSREP: Failed to read from: wsrep_sst_xtrabackup-v2%') as 'xtrabackup_read_fail'

## [!UICONTROL Database mysql-slow.log]

![database mysql-slow.log](../../assets/tools/database-mysql-slow-log.jpg)

The **[!UICONTROL Database mysql-slow.log]** frame does a count of entries in the [mysql-slow.log](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/slow-query-log.html) by query request type. It isolates timeframes visually that might be of interest in the mysql-slow.log (slow query log). Queries of tables without indices or queries that update large tables may block other queries.

## [!UICONTROL Redis synchronization from Log]

![redis synchronization from log](../../assets/tools/redis-synchronization-from-log.jpg)

[[!DNL Redis]](https://redis.io/docs/about/) is an open source (BSD licensed) in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. It can do database and session caching if configured. The **[!UICONTROL Redis synchronization from Log]** frame focuses on [[!DNL Redis] synchronization](https://redis.io/docs/manual/replication/). The larger the [!DNL Redis] dataset, the more likely that there will be problems with the synchronization (more data to keep synchronized).

**[!DNL Redis] errors and messages:**

* '%SLAVE synchronization: No space left on device%') as 'space'
* '%Server started, Redis version%') as 'serv_start'
