## Issue

The GraphQL product search results are limited to 10,000 results only.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Generate *[!UICONTROL 15,000 products]* in one category.
1. Query that category with GraphQL request attached below:

```GraphQL
{
  products(
    filter: { category_id: { eq: "{CATEGORY_ID}" } }
    pageSize: 5
    currentPage: 1
  ) {
    total_count
    page_info {
      current_page
      page_size
      total_pages
    }

    aggregations {
      attribute_code
      count
      label
      options {
        label
        value
      }
    }

    items {
      uid
      sku
      is_for_clearance
      categories {
        name
        breadcrumbs {
          category_name
          category_uid
        }
        display_mode
        description
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<u>Expected results</u>:

`total_count = 15k`

Possibility to get all products in the search results.

<u>Actual results</u>:

`total_count = 10k`

No possibility of getting products following this 10k batch in the search results.
