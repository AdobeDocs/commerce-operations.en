## Issue

The setShippingAddressesOnCart mutation doesn't allow setting numeric region code as "region".

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a cart using the below query.

    <pre>
    <code class="language-graphql">
    mutation {
      createEmptyCart
    }
    </code>
    </pre>

1. Send a request to set the shipping address to the cart.

    <pre>
    <code class="language-graphql">
    mutation ($cartId: String!) {
      setShippingAddressesOnCart(
        input: {
          cart_id: $cartId
          shipping_addresses: {
            address: {
              firstname: "Tomek"
              lastname: "Nowak"
              company: "Company Name"
              street: ["234 Rue de Rivoli"]
              region: "58"
              city: "Lille"
              postcode: "59800"
              country_code: "FR"
              telephone: "123-456-0000"
              save_in_address_book: false
            }
          }
        }
        ) {
          cart {
            shipping_addresses {
              firstname
              lastname
              company
              street
              city
              region {
                code
                label
              }
              postcode
              telephone
              country {
                code
                label
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
      </code>
      </pre>

      Note: country code is set to "FR" and the region code to "58" in this example. According to the `directory_country_region` Db table, region code 58 is "Nièvre".

1. Check the response that is returned.

<u>Expected results</u>:

Adobe Commerce allows setting numeric region code in the GraphQL request.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The region code is changed to 47.

<pre>
<code class="language-graphql">
{
  "data": {
    "setShippingAddressesOnCart": {
      "cart": {
        "shipping_addresses": [
        {
          "firstname": "Tomek",
          "lastname": "Nowak",
          "company": "Company Name",
          "street": [
          "234 Rue de Rivoli"
          ],
          "city": "Lille",
          "region": {
            "code": "47",
            "label": "Lot-et-Garonne"
            },
            "postcode": "59800",
            "telephone": "123-456-0000",
            "country": {
              "code": "FR",
              "label": "FR"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
</code>
</pre>
