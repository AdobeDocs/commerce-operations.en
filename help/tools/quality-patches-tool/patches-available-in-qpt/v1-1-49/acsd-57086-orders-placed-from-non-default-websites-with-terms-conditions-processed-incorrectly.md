## Issue

While using a multi-store setup with AsyncOrder processing, orders placed on any websites/stores other than the main website are rejected due to issues with scope handling in the queue consumer code.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Install [!DNL RabbitMQ] and execute `bin/magento setup:upgrade` to create the queues for [!DNL RabbitMQ].
1. Configure AsyncOrder processing with:

    ```bash
    bin/magento setup:config:set --checkout-async 1
    ```

1. Create a secondary website, a store, and a store view.
1. Create a product that is shared between both websites.
1. Enable terms and conditions:
    1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL Sales]** > **[!UICONTROL Checkout]** > **[!UICONTROL Checkout Options]**.
    1. Set *[!UICONTROL Enable Terms And Conditions]* to *Yes*.
1. Configure terms and conditions for both the websites:
    1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Terms And Conditions]** > **[!UICONTROL Add New Condition]**.
    1. Use the following settings:
        * *[!UICONTROL Condition Name]*: *Anything*
        * *[!UICONTROL Status]*: *[!UICONTROL Enabled]*
        * *[!UICONTROL Applied]*: *[!UICONTROL Manually]*
        * *[!UICONTROL Store View]*: *[!UICONTROL Default Store View]*
    1. Create another condition for the second website/store view.
1. Change the default website by going to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL All Stores]**. Click the second website, check *[!UICONTROL Set as Default]* and save.
1. Clear the cache with:

    ```bash
    bin/magento cache:clear
    ```

1. Go to the Storefront and add a product to the cart. Proceed to checkout and place an order (you should see a checkbox in the payment method step to accept the terms and conditions).
1. Go back to Admin after placing the order, and change the default website back to the original main website and save.
1. Clear the cache:

    ```bash
    bin/magento cache:clear
    ```

1. Run the following command to start the queue consumer:

    ```bash
    bin/magento queue:cons:start placeOrderProcessor
    ```

<u>Expected results</u>:

Order is fulfilled; it is not automatically rejected.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Order status is *rejected* with the following comment: 

*The order wasn't placed. First, agree to the terms and conditions, then try placing your order again.*
