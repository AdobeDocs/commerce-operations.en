## Issue

Filtering products for price from zero in a GraphQL products search leads to a malformed request to [!DNL OpenSearch] and does not return any results.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a category with two simple products:
    * simple1 - price $0
    * simple2 - price $10
1. Make sure that both the products are visible on the frontend. 
1. Send a request with `price:{from:"1"}`.

    ```graphql
    query {
      products(
        pageSize: 50
        currentPage: 1,
        filter: {price:{from:"1"}}
      ) {
        totalResult: total_count
        productItems: items {
          sku
          urlKey: url_key
          price: price_range {
            fullPrice: minimum_price {
              finalPrice: final_price {
                currency
                value
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

1. This returns the product, *simple2*.
1. Now send a request with `price:{from:"0"}`.

    ```graphql
    query {
      products(
        pageSize: 50
        currentPage: 1,
        filter: {price:{from:"0"}}
      ) {
        totalResult: total_count
        productItems: items {
          sku
          urlKey: url_key
          price: price_range {
            fullPrice: minimum_price {
              finalPrice: final_price {
                currency
                value
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

<u>Expected results</u>: 

Both the products, *simple1* and *simple2*, are returned.

<u>Actual results</u>:

No products are returned.

```json
{
    "data": {
        "products": {
            "totalResult": 0,
            "productItems": []
        }
    }
}
```
