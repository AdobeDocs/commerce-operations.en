## Issue

Product images are removed after deleting a staging update.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. On the Commerce Admin sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** > **[!UICONTROL Products]** and create a product.
1. Under **[!UICONTROL Images and Videos]**, upload an image and save the product.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Scheduled Changes]** box, select **[!UICONTROL Schedule New Update]**. 
   1. Choose a start date a few minutes in the future.
   1. Do not choose an end date.
1. In the  **[!UICONTROL Scheduled Changes]** box, select the **[!UICONTROL View/Edit]** link.
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Remove from Update]** > **[!UICONTROL Delete the Update]** and select **[!UICONTROL Done]**.
1. Refresh the page.

<u>Expected results</u>:

Since the update is removed before the scheduled start date, the product should remain the same.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The image content is lost and shows zero bytes.
