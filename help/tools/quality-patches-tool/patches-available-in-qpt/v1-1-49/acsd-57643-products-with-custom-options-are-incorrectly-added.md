## Issue

Products with custom options are incorrectly added to the shopping cart via GraphQL.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a custom option type field for the product.
1. Generate a customer token using GraphQL.
1. Create an empty cart.
1. Add the product to the cart using the below payload:

    ```graphql
    mutation {
      addProductsToCart(
        cartId: "wNVOTaE6sDCJoObZCCqikHQI3GyFaVif"
        cartItems: [
          {
            quantity: 1
            sku: "24-MB01"
            entered_options: [{
              uid:"Y3VzdG9tLW9wdGlvbi8x",
              value:"product1 option1 "
            }]
          },
          {
            quantity: 1
            sku: "24-MB01"
            entered_options: [{
              uid:"Y3VzdG9tLW9wdGlvbi8x",
              value:"product2 option1"
            }]
          }
          {
            quantity: 3
            sku: "24-MB01",
            entered_options: [{
              uid:"Y3VzdG9tLW9wdGlvbi8x"
              value:"product3 option1"
            }]        
          }
        ]
      ) {
        cart {
          items {
            product {
              name
              sku
            }
            ... on SimpleCartItem {
              customizable_options {
                customizable_option_uid
                label
                values {
                  customizable_option_value_uid
                  value
                }
              }
            }
            quantity
          }
        }
        user_errors {
          code
          message
        }
      }
    }
    ```

1. You will see that the product is added only once:

    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "addProductsToCart": {
          "cart": {
            "items": [
              {
                "product": {
                  "name": "Joust Duffle Bag",
                  "sku": "24-MB01"
                },
                "customizable_options": [
                  {
                    "customizable_option_uid": "Y3VzdG9tLW9wdGlvbi8x",
                    "label": "Option1",
                    "values": [
                      {
                        "customizable_option_value_uid": "Y3VzdG9tLW9wdGlvbi8x",
                        "value": "product1 option1"
                      }
                    ]
                  }
                ],
                "quantity": 5
              }
            ]
          },
          "user_errors": []
        }
      }
    }
    ```

<u>Expected results</u>:

A product can be added to the shopping cart using different custom options for the same SKU simultaneously.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Unable to add a product to the shopping cart using different custom options for the same SKU simultaneously.
