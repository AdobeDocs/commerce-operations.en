## Issue

URL rewrites cause infinite page looping  after **[!UICONTROL Website Root]** is deselected from **[!UICONTROL Hierarchy]**.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a CMS page named *Test-Parent*.
1. Create a page named *Test-Child*, and in the **[!UICONTROL Hierarchy]** section, select **[!UICONTROL Website Root]** > **[!UICONTROL Parent]** and save.
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Marketing]** > **[!UICONTROL URL Rewrites]**.
1. Notice that there are two new rewrites:
   * Request path to *Test-Parent* that points to *cms/page/view/page_id/ID_NUMBER_FOR_PAGE*
   * Request path to *Test-Child* that points to *cms/page/view/page_id/ID_NUMBER_FOR_PAGE*
1. Visit the storefront and add *test-child* to the URL. You should see the child page.
1. Do the same thing, but add *test-parent/test-child/* to the URL and see the same page.
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Marketing]** > **[!UICONTROL URL Rewrites]** and select **[!UICONTROL Add URL Rewrite]**. Choose the following settings:
   * Type: *Custom*
   * Request path: *test-parent/test-child*
   * Target path: *test-child*
   * Redirect Type: *Permanent (301)*
1. Visit the *test-parent/test-child* path and you should be redirected to *test-child*.
1. Edit the Child page (**[!UICONTROL Content]** > **[!UICONTROL Elements]** > **[!UICONTROL Pages]** > Pick Child and select **[!UICONTROL Edit]**).
1. Under the **[!UICONTROL Hierarchy]** section, keep *Test-Parent* selected but unselect **[!UICONTROL Website Root]** and save.
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Marketing]** > **[!UICONTROL URL Rewrites]** and notice that the original *test-child* to *cms/page/view/page_id* redirect is missing, and at that point it is substituted by a path that points the *test-child* to *test-parent/test-child*.
1. Visit the storefront and try to visit the *Test-Child* page.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The *Test-Child* page is opened.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The *Test-Child* page is not opened. The browser tries to open the *test-parent/test-child* page in an infinite loop.
