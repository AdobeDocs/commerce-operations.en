## Issue

The loading speed of the image gallery is slow when the `pub/media` folder is very big.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Go to the Adobe Commerce Admin > **[!UICONTROL STORES]** > **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL Advanced]** > **[!UICONTROL System]** > **[!UICONTROL Media Gallery]** > **[!UICONTROL Enable Old Media Gallery]** to _No_.
1. Clean the config cache.
1. Log out and log in as an admin user again.
1. On the Admin sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** > **[!UICONTROL Categories]** and select the root category.
1. Expand the **[!UICONTROL Content]** section and click on **[!UICONTROL Select from Gallery]**.

When loading the page, Adobe Commerce sends `media_gallery/directories/gettree` request to load the media folder tree.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The `media_gallery/directories/gettree` request should load content only from the necessary directories, other than looping the entire path list from the `pub/media/` folder.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The `media_gallery/directories/gettree` request takes a long time to load when the `pub/media/` folder has lots of content.
