## Issue

The **[!UICONTROL Continue to Checkout]** button is greyed out even if the subtotal is greater than the configured minimum order amount.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Go to the Adobe Commerce Admin > **[!UICONTROL Store]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL Sales]** > **[!UICONTROL Minimum Order Amount]** and set the following: 
    * [!UICONTROL Enable]: *[!UICONTROL Yes]*
    * [!UICONTROL Minimum Amount]: *2*

1. Create a [!UICONTROL Cart Price Rule].
    * [!UICONTROL Coupon Code]: *[!UICONTROL TEST (optional)]*
    * [!UICONTROL Conditions]: *[!UICONTROL Keep empty]*
    * [!UICONTROL Actions]:
        * [!UICONTROL Apply]: *[!UICONTROL Percent of product price discount]*
        * [!UICONTROL Discount Amount]: *92*
        * [!UICONTROL Apply to Shipping Amount]: *[!UICONTROL Yes]*
1. Create a product with the price of $25.
1. Add the product to the cart.
