## Issue

The stock status of composite products (bundle, grouped, and configurable) is not updated when the sub-product stock status is changed via REST API POST `/rest/V1/inventory/source-items`.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a configurable, bundled, and grouped product with one simple child product for each.
1. Set each simple child product status to **[!UICONTROL Out of Stock]** using the `source-items` API call.
1. Now check the parent product's stock status.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The parent product's status is [!UICONTROL Out of Stock].

<u>Actual results</u>:

The parent product's status is [!UICONTROL In Stock].
