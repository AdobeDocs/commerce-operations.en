## Issue

SEO-friendly URLs are not generated for products that have url_key attributes overridden on the store-view level.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Set the configuration as follows by going to the **[!UICONTROL Commerce Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** > **[!UICONTROL Search Engine Optimization]**:
    * [!UICONTROL Use Categories Path for Product URLs] = *Yes*
    * [!UICONTROL Generate "category/product" URL Rewrites] = *Yes*
1. Clean the configuration cache.
1. Create two categories: [!UICONTROL Category 1] and [!UICONTROL Category 2].
1. Create two products: [!UICONTROL Product 1] in [!UICONTROL Category 1], [!UICONTROL Product 2] in [!UICONTROL Category 1].
1. Change the scope to [!UICONTROL Default Store View] for [!UICONTROL Product 1].
1. Uncheck the optional URL [!UICONTROL Key] in [!UICONTROL Search Engine Optimization].
1. Save the product.
1. Switch back to [!UICONTROL All Store Views].
1. Add [!UICONTROL Product 1] to [!UICONTROL Category 2], and add [!UICONTROL Product 2] to [!UICONTROL Category 2].
1. Check the `url_rewrite` table or [!UICONTROL Marketing] > [!UICONTROL SEO & Search] > [!UICONTROL URL Rewrites].

<u>Expected results</u>:

The SEO-friendly URL for [!UICONTROL Category 2] is created for [!UICONTROL Product 1].

<u>Actual results</u>:

The SEO-friendly URL for [!UICONTROL Category 2] is missing for [!UICONTROL Product 1] because it had the URL key attribute overwritten for the store view scope.
