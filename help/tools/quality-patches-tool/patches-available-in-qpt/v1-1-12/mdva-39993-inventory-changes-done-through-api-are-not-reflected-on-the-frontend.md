## Issue

The inventory changes done through API are not reflected on the storefront product page.

<u>Prerequisites</u>:

Inventory modules installed.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Make sure the queue is set to execute with cron and cron is installed and running.
1. Create a configurable product (COC001), with two colors (Black and Red), and two sizes (M and L).
1. Make one option out of stock (COC001-Red-M).
1. Load the configurable product page on the storefront and try clicking on each color. When you click **Red**, the size **M** should be crossed out because it is out of stock.
1. Make COC001-Red-M in stock using the following API endpoint and the payload:

    ```json
    POST http://{domain}/rest/V1/inventory/source-items

    {
      "sourceItems": [
        {
          "sku": "COC001-Red-M",
          "source_code": "default",
          "quantity": 1000,
          "status": 1
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

1. Check this simple product from the backend and verify that it is updated to In Stock.
1. Load the configurable product from the frontend and click on each color. Notice the size **M** when you click on **Red**.

<u>Expected results</u>:

COC001-Red-M option is not crossed out because we have updated it to In Stock through API.

<u>Actual results</u>:

COC001-Red-M option is still crossed out, even though it is In Stock.
