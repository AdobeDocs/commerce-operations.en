## Issue

The catalog price rule based on store-level attribute match fails to apply after partial reindex.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Set indexer mode to run on schedule.
1. Create two configurable product attributes. For example: Color (Visual Swatch) and Size (Text Swatch).
1. Create a configurable product using both attributes created in Step 2.
1. After creating the products, create a **Yes/No** type attribute and make it visible in the rule conditions.
1. Add this attribute to the default attribute set.
1. Create a catalog price rule to apply when this attribute is set to **Yes**.
1. Open one of the simple products related to the configurable product.
1. Change the scope to store view and update the attribute value to **Yes**.
1. Run the `CRON` and check the price on the frontend.
1. Run a full reindex. Again, check the price on the frontend.
1. Update the configurable product category.
1. Run the `CRON` and check the price again on the frontend.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The catalog rule applies correctly without a full reindex using incremental indexers.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The catalog rule doesn't apply without running a full reindex.
