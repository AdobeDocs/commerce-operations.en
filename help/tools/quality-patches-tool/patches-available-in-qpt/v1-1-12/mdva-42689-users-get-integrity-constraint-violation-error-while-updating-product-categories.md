## Issue

Adobe Commerce throws an Integrity Constraint Violation error while updating product categories during import.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Set up two websites.
1. Create subcategories under the root category up to two levels on the category page. For example, Root Category > **Gear** > **Watches**.
1. Create two simple products and assign both the products to the same **Gear** > **Watches** category.
1. Assign one simple product to both websites.
1. Save the product.
1. Prepare a CSV file for import. There should be two product records with different store views. One of the products should belong to both these store views.
1. Now import the CSV file by navigating to **System** > **Import** > **Entity Type** (Products).

<u>Expected results</u>:

CSV file is imported without any error.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Adobe Commerce throws the following error:

```SQL
SQLSTATE[23000]: Integrity constraint violation: 1062 Duplicate entry '1302' for key 'PRIMARY', query was: INSERT INTO `catalog_url_rewrite_product_category` (`url_rewrite_id`,`category_id`,`product_id`) VALUES (?, ?, ?), (?, ?, ?), (?, ?, ?)
