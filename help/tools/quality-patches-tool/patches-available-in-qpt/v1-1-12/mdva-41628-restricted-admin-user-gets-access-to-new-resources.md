## Issue

Restricted admin users can get access to the new resources when new modules are added.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a new admin user role with restricted resources.
1. Create a new admin user under the role created in step one.
1. Install and enable the custom module that creates a new set of menu items along with ACL resources.
1. Log in using the newly created admin user.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The admin user with restricted access is unable to access the newly created menu items.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The restricted admin user is able to access the new menu items, even though the new resources are not assigned to the user role.
