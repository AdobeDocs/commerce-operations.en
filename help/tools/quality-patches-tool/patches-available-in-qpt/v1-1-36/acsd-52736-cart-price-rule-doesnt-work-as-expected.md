## Issue

A [!UICONTROL Cart Price Rule] that includes the requirements for configurable product quantity doesn't work as expected.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a cart rule:
    * [!UICONTROL Apply] = Percent of product price discount
    * [!UICONTROL Discount Amount] = 60
    * [!UICONTROL Maximum Qty Discount is Applied to] = 1
    * [!UICONTROL Discount Qty Step (Buy X)] = 1
    * Apply the rule only to the cart items matching the following conditions: Quantity in cart is 1
2. Add a product with [!UICONTROL Qty] = 2, to the cart.
3. Check cart prices.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The rule is not applied because the quantity of the products in the cart is *2*.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The discount is applied.

<u> Additional steps required after the patch installation</u>:

After applying the patch, the cart rule conditions using the *Quantity* attribute must be removed and added again.
