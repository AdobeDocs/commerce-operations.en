## Issue

You get the error *The session has expired, please login again.* when trying to log in with the new password from one device after resetting the password on a different device. It only happens if there's an additional Ajax request on the page added by a custom module.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Install a custom module that adds an Ajax request on every page on the storefront.
1. Create a new account.
1. Log out and go back to the login page.
1. Open the *Forgot Password* link in a different browser and send the *Reset Password* email.
1. Open the reset password email in the first browser and set the new password.
1. Try to log in in the second browser.

<u>Expected results</u>:

You are able to log in successfully on the first attempt.

<u>Actual results</u>:

* You see the *The session has expired, please login again.* error.
* You are not logged in and redirected to the homepage.
* Your second attempt to log in is successful.
