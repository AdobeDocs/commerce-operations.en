## Issue

An "Internal Error" occurs as all levels of [!DNL REST API] payload are not validated.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Add a product to the customer's cart.
1. Send the [!DNL REST API] request to `rest/V1/carts/mine/estimate-shipping-methods` using a wrong attribute "_street._" with a dot in the end.

```
 {
    "address": {
         "street.": [
             "\uc11c\uc6b8 \uac15\ubd81\uad6c \ud55c\ucc9c\ub85c166\uae38 2 (-\uc11c\uc6b8 \uac15\ubd81\uad6c \uc218\uc720\ub3d9 269-36)"
         ],
         "city": "pune",
         "region": null,
         "country_id": "IN",
         "postcode": "411015",
         "customer_id": "2",
         "firstname": "test",
         "lastname": "test",
         "middlename": null,
         "prefix": null,
         "suffix": null,
         "vat_id": null,
         "company": null,
         "telephone": "00000000000",
         "fax": null,
         "custom_attributes": []
     }
 }
```

<u>Expected results</u>:

The endpoint should validate the parameter and return the `400 status code` with a specific error message. Example:

```
report.CRITICAL: LogicException: Property "Street." does not have accessor method "getStreet." in class "Magento\Quote\Api\Data\AddressInterface". in vendor/magento/framework/Reflection/NameFinder.php:103
```

<u>Actual results</u>:

The endpoint does not validate the wrong parameter and returns the `500 status code` error.
