## Issue

[!DNL GraphQL] does not return products beyond *10k* in the search results.

<u>Prerequisites</u>:

In case of **[!DNL OpenSearch]**, ensure that you are using the latest available version. 

To resolve the reported issue, the Point in Time functionality is introduced, which is available after **[!DNL OpenSearch]** 2.5.0 and requires version 2.2 of the `opensearch-project/opensearch-php` package. 

However, there is a conflict with the `magento/magento-cloud-metapackage`, which specifies a dependency on the `opensearch-project/opensearch-php` package that should be less than version 2.0.1.  


This dependency prevents updating the [opensearch-project/opensearch-php] package to the latest version 2.2. 

As a result, the system encounters the following error and returns null results for products exceeding *10,000*.

`Namespace [createPointInTime] not found in /vendor/opensearch-project/opensearch-php/src/OpenSearch/Client.php:135`

The existing dependency makes it challenging to directly add a version to the `composer.json` file and update the `opensearch-project/opensearch-php` package to version 2.2.

To resolve the issue, include the following line in your main `composer.json` file under the require block. Afterward, redeploy to update the problematic package to the latest version.

`"opensearch-project/opensearch-php": "2.2.0 as 2.0.0",`

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Generate the catalog with *15k* products.
1. Send the [!DNL GraphQL]:

```
    query {
    products(
    filter: {
    # category_id:{eq:""}
    }
    , pageSize: 5, currentPage: 1

    ) {
    total_count
    page_info {
    current_page
    page_size
    total_pages
     }

     aggregations {

    attribute_code
    count
    label
    options {
    label
    value

    }
    }

    items {
    uid
    sku
    is_for_clearance
    categories {
    name
    breadcrumbs {
    category_name
    category_uid
    }
    display_mode
    description
    }
    }
    }
    }
```

<u>Expected results</u>:

Total_count = *15k*
You should be able to show all of the products.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Total_count = *10k*
You can't get any more products to show after the *10k* batch.
