## Issue

The deferred proxies and proxy factories are missing after running `setup:di:compile`.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a custom module named *Magento_CustomModule*.
1. In the *[!UICONTROL etc]* folder of the module, create a `di.xml` with this content:
   
    ```xml
     <?xml version="1.0"?>
      <config xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:framework:ObjectManager/etc/config.xsd">
         <type name="Magento\Catalog\Model\ProductLink\CollectionProvider">
            <arguments>
               <argument name="providers" xsi:type="array">
                  <item name="crosssell" xsi:type="object">
                       Magento\Catalog\Model\ProductLink\CollectionProvider\Crosssell\Proxy
                  </item>
                    <item name="upsell" xsi:type="object">Magento\Catalog\Model\ProductLink\CollectionProvider\Upsell\Proxy</item>
                      <item name="related" xsi:type="object">Magento\Catalog\Model\ProductLink\CollectionProvider\Related\Proxy</item>
               </argument>
            </arguments>
          </type>
             <type name="Magento\Catalog\Model\Product">
                <arguments>
                   <argument name="catalogProductStatus" xsi:type="object">
                    Magento\Catalog\Model\Product\Attribute\Source\Status\Proxy
                   </argument>
                    <argument name="productLink" xsi:type="object">
                      Magento\Catalog\Model\Product\Link\Proxy
                    </argument>
                </arguments>
              </type>
      </config>
    ```

1. Set the [!UICONTROL Production] mode: `bin/magento deploy:mode:set production`.
1. Delete the generated folder from the magento root. 
1. Run the command `bin/magento setup:di:compile`.
1. Check the generated folder.

<u>Expected results</u>:

* Proxy files are successfully created after compilation.
* Factory files are successfully created after compilation.

<u>Actual results</u>:

In the generated folder, the proxy file is generated for proxy arguments that are given without a line break, and not for the arguments that are given with a line break.
