## Issue

The `base_row_total` and `row_total` in the order details REST API response show the unit price instead of the total price when multiple quantities of the same item are ordered.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create two simple products: simple1 priced at $10 and simple2 priced at $15.
1. Create a new customer account.
1. Add simple1 to the cart with quantity 2 and simple2 with quantity 3.
1. Place the order using the customer account.
1. Obtain an admin token by sending a POST request to `/rest/V1/integration/admin/token` with the following payload:

    ```
    {
      "username": "admin",
      "password": "password"
    }
    ```

1. Retrieve the order details using a GET request to `/rest/default/V1/orders/1`.

<u>Expected results</u>:

`base_row_total` and `row_total` should reflect the total price calculated as quantity multiplied by item price (for example, 2 Ã— $10 = $20 for simple1).

<u>Actual results</u>:

`base_row_total` and `row_total` return only the unit price (for example, $10 for simple1 instead of $20).
