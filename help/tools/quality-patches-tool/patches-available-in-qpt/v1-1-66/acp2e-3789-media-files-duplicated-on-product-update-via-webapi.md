# ACP2E-3789: Media files duplicated on product update via WebAPI

The ACP2E-3789 patch fixes the issue where product updates via WebAPI duplicate media files when a media ID is provided. This patch is available when the [[!DNL Quality Patches Tool (QPT)]](/help/tools/quality-patches-tool/quality-patches-tool-to-self-serve-quality-patches.md) 1.1.66 is installed. The patch ID is ACP2E-3789. Please note that this issue is scheduled to be fixed in Adobe Commerce 2.4.9.

## Affected products and versions

**The patch is created for Adobe Commerce version:**

* Adobe Commerce (all deployment methods) 2.4.7-p3

**Compatible with Adobe Commerce versions:**

* Adobe Commerce (all deployment methods) 2.4.5 - 2.4.8

>[!NOTE]
>
>The patch might become applicable to other versions with new [!DNL Quality Patches Tool] releases. To check if the patch is compatible with your Adobe Commerce version, update the `magento/quality-patches` package to the latest version and check the compatibility on the [[!DNL Quality Patches Tool]: Search for patches page](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/tools/commerce-quality-patches/index.html). Use the patch ID as a search keyword to locate the patch.

## Issue

Updating a product via WebAPI with a media ID causes the system to duplicate media files instead of replacing them, creating new files with each API call and resulting in a buildup of images that overloads the `/pub/media/catalog/products/cache/` directory.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a product and add an image.
1. Get product details using the REST API at `base_url/rest/V1/products/<sku>`.
1. Perform a PUT request to update the product, keeping the `media_gallery_entrie`s unchanged (same image name and file).
1. Check the `pub/media/catalog/product/xx/yy` directory before and after the update.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The image file is replaced when the media ID is included in the request.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The image is duplicated with a new name (for example, wb04-blue-1.jpg), causing unnecessary file buildup.
