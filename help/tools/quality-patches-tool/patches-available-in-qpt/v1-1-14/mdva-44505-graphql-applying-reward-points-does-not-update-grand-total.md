## Issue

The GraphQL query for a cart applying reward points does not consider the reward points and returns an incorrect grand total.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Configure reward points.
1. Create a cart and apply some reward points.
1. Call the `GetCart` query from the `GraphQL` endpoint and retrieve your cart:

    ```GraphQL
    query {
      cart(cart_id: "{CART_ID}") {
        prices {
          discounts {
            amount {
              value
            }
          }
          grand_total {
            value
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
1. Check the grand total entry.
1. Now check the customer's cart total using rest API (`/rest/V1/carts/mine/totals`).

<u>Expected results</u>:

The GraphQL query for the cart returns the correct grand total which considers the reward points.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The GraphQL query does not consider the reward points and returns an incorrect grand total.
