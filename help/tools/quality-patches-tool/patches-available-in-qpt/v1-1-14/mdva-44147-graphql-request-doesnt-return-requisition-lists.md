## Issue

GraphQL request doesn't return Requisition Lists.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Go to **Store** > **Settings** > **Configuration** > **General** > **B2B Features** and enable Requisition List.
1. Log in as a customer and add a product to the [Requisition List](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/customers/account-dashboard-requisition-lists.html).
1. Create a [Customer Token](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/graphql/mutations/generate-customer-token.html).

    <pre>
    <code class="language-graphql">
    mutation {
      generateCustomerToken(
        email: "test@gmail.com"
        password: "xxxxxxxx"
        ) {
          token
        }
      }
      </code>
      </pre>

1. Use the following query to retrieve all the Requisition Lists from the customer. Use the **Authorization** header with the value `Bearer <customer_token>`. Refer to the [Customer Query](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/graphql/queries/customer.html) article in our developer documentation for more information.

          ) {
            items {
              uid
              name
              description
              items(pageSize: 20) {
                items {
                  uid
                  product {
                    uid
                    name
                    sku
                    __typename
                  }
                  quantity
                }

          }
        }
      }
      </code>

    Response:

    <pre>
    <code class="language-graphql">
    {
      "data": {
        "customer": {
          "requisition_lists": {
            "items": [
            {

                    "__typename": "SimpleProduct"
                    },
                    "quantity": 1

                  "total_pages": 1
                }
              }

            }
          }

1. Copy the UID of any item from the list returned (MQ==) and use the following query to get the list filtered by the UID.

    <pre>
    <code class="language-graphql">
    query {
      customer {
        requisition_lists(
          pageSize: 20,
          filter: {
            uids: {
              eq: "MQ=="
            }
          }
          ) {
            items {
              uid
              name
              description
              items(pageSize: 20) {
                items {
                  uid
                  product {
                    uid
                    name
                    sku
                    __typename
                  }
                  quantity
                }
                total_pages
              }
            }
            total_count
          }
