## Issue

Salable quantity is not updated correctly when a refund is done using REST API.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Add an item to the cart.
1. Check the Stock Qty and Salable Qty.
1. Create an order.
1. Create an invoice if needed.
1. Submit a REST request to refund the invoice using the following payload:

    * offline method/order/`<order_id>`/refund
    * online method/invoice/`<invoice_id>`/refund

    ```rest
    {
      "items": [
      {
        "order_item_id": <order_item_id>,
        "qty": 1
      }
      ],
      "notify": true,
      "arguments": {
        "shipping_amount": 5,
        "extension_attributes": {
          "return_to_stock_items": [
          <order_item_id>
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

1. Do not ship the items.
1. Compare the Stock Qty and the Salable Qty from before. They should both be updated by the same amount.

<u>Expected results</u>:

Salable quantity is updated correctly when a refund is issued before shipping the order, and the product is returned to the stock.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Salable quantity is not updated when a refund is issued before shipping the order, and the product is returned to the stock.
