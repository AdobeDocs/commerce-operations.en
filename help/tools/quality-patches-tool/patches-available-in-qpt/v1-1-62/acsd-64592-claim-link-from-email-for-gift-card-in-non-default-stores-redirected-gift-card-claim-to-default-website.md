## Issue

In a multi-website setup, when a Virtual Gift Card is purchased from a secondary (non-default) site, the email containing the Gift Card Code link directs users to the default website's URL.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1 Create a secondary Website, Store and Store View.
1 Configure different Base URLs for the Base and the secondary website.
1 Create a Virtual Gift Card with some Amount options.
1 Generate a new code pool at **[!UICONTROL Marketing]** > **[!UICONTROL Promotions]** > **[!UICONTROL Gift Card Accounts]**.
1 Place an order with the Gift Card productÂ on the secondary website.
1 Invoice the order in the admin.
1 Check the URL in the Gift Card Code link of the *You've been sent a gift from Two* email.


<u>Expected results</u>:

The Gift Card Code link should have the link to the second website.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The Gift Card Code link has the default website URL, even though the order is placed on the second website
