## Issue

Product export uses category names from the default store view scope.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a custom store view **[!UICONTROL Thai]** inside the main store.
1. Make **[!UICONTROL Thai]** the default store view of the main website.
1. Create the following category structure under **[!UICONTROL Default Category]**:

    *[!UICONTROL Default category/Tea/Black]*

1. Select the category **[!UICONTROL Tea]** and change the **[!UICONTROL Scope]** to **[!UICONTROL Thai]**.
1. Set the **[!UICONTROL Category Name]** as **[!UICONTROL ชาดำ]**.
1. Create a simple product **[!UICONTROL SP001]** and assign the category **[!UICONTROL Black]**.
1. Make sure the cron does not run.
1. Do a product export. Filter by SKU and select **[!UICONTROL SP001]**.
1. Check the **[!UICONTROL categories]** column in the exported CSV.

<u>Expected results</u>:

As no store was selected during export, you should get a category path like the following: *[!UICONTROL Default Category/Tea/Black]*.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Category path has mixed languages: *[!UICONTROL Default Category/ชาดำ/Black]*.
