## Issue

<u>Prerequisites</u>:

Create a few different products with the same price.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Run the following GraphQL query:

    ```GraphQL
    {
      products(filter: {category_id: {eq: "{{cat_id}}"}}, sort: {relevance: ASC}) {
        total_count
        items {
          name
          sku
        }
      }
    }
    ```

1. Check the response.
1. Change the sort order from **ASC** to **DESC** in the GraphQL query:

    ```GraphQL
    {
      products(filter: {category_id: {eq: "{{cat_id}}"}}, sort: {relevance: DESC}) {
        total_count
        items {
          name
          sku
        }
      }
    }
   ```
       
1. Check the response.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The product listing in the GraphQL response should be changed according to the sort order.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The sort order remains unchanged.
