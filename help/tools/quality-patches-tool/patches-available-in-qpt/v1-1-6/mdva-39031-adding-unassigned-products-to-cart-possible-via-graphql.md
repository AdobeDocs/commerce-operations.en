## Issue

Adding a product to the cart via GraphQL is possible even if it is not assigned to the target website.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a secondary website.
1. Create a product and assign it to the primary website.
1. Create an empty cart for the secondary website using GraphQL.

    <pre>
    <code class="language-graphql">
    mutation{
     createEmptyCart
    }
    </code>
    </pre>

    With headers like:

    <pre>
    <code class="language-graphql">
    {
      "Store":"en_au"
    }
    </code>
    </pre>

1. Add the product assigned to the primary website to the cart in secondary website.

    <pre>
    <code class="language-graphql">
    mutation {
      addProductsToCart(
          cartId: "XHrUN2nJ37OqDByhtL0VC8OxYsEZs41c"
          cartItems: [
            {
              quantity: 1
              sku: "p1"
            }
          ]
        ) {
          cart {
           items {
            product {
              name
              sku
            }
            quantity
          }
        }
      }
    }
    </code>
    </pre>

    Headers

    <pre>
    <code class="language-graphql">
    {
      "Store":"en_au"
    }
    </code>
    </pre>

<u>Expected results</u>:

The product is not added to the cart because it was not assigned to the store defined in the header.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The product gets added to the cart successfully.
