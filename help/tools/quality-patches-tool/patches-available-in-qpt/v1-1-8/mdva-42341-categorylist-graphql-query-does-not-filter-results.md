## Issue

The "categoryList" GraphQL query does not filter results if a request has the Store header.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a new Root Category and name it **root2**.
1. Create a second Website/Store/Storeview and assign **root2** to the new Store.
1. Create a new category under Default root category = category1.
1. Using a GraphQL request, get a categories list for the second website (use Header store = new).

<pre>
<code class="language-graphql">
{
  categoryList(filters: {name: {match: "category1"}}) {
    uid
    level
    name
    breadcrumbs {
      category_uid
      category_name
      category_level
      category_url_key
    }
  }
}
</code>
</pre>

<u>Expected results</u>:

Categories from the default Root Category are not listed in response since we are using a "new" store Header.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Categories from the default Root Category are available in results.
