## Issue

Catalog rules stop working for a configurable product if its simple product is re-named.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a configurable product with an associated simple product.
1. Create a category.
1. Assign only the configurable product to the new category.
1. Create new catalog rules:
    * Condition = Category contains \<new category id>
    * Action = 50% discount
    * Active = Yes
1. Perform reindex.
1. Check the configurable product on the frontend (the discount should be applied).
1. Check the `catalogrule_product` table (the simple product should have a discount).
1. Go to the Admin and change the name of the simple product. This would add a record to the `catalogrule_product_cl` table.
1. Execute the cron or the `bin/magento cron:run --group=index --bootstrap=standaloneProcessStarted=1` command.
1. Check the `catalogrule_product` table.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The configurable product has a discount.

<u>Actual results</u>:

* The discount records created for the simple products are missing in the `catalogrule_product` table.
* The configurable product on the frontend has the full original price.
