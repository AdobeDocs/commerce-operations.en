## Issue

Customers get an error on checkout after the session timeout, even if the Persistent Shopping Cart is enabled.

<u>Prerequisites</u>:

1. Go to **Config** > **General** > **Web** > **Default Cookie Settings** > **Cookie Lifetime** and set to **120**.
1. Go to **Config** > **Customers** > **Customer Configuration** > **Online Customers Options** and set both values to **2**.
1. Go to **Config** > **Customers** > **Persistent Shopping Cart** and set to **Enable**.
1. Go to **Config** > **Sales** > **Payment Methods** and turn off all payment methods except **Check/Money Order** (it should be enabled).

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Log in as a customer and add some products to the cart.
1. Check the shopping cart.
1. Wait for two minutes (set in precondition); the session should timeout.
1. Click **Go to checkout** and do not refresh the page.
1. Checkout as a guest, fill shipping address and choose a shipping method.
1. Click **Next**.
1. On the **Review & Payments** page, click **Place Order**. Since only one payment method is allowed, the customer should be able to place the order without selecting the payment method.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The customer should be able to place the order.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The customer gets the following error: *Failed address validation: Email has a wrong format*.
