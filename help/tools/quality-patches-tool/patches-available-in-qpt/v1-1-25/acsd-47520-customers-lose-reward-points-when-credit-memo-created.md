## Issue

Customers lose reward points when a credit memo is created.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Go the Adobe Commerce Admin > **[!UICONTROL Store]** > **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL Customers]** > **[!UICONTROL Reward Points]**.
1. Change the setting:
   * **[!UICONTROL Enable Reward Points Functionality]** = _Yes_
   * **[!UICONTROL Enable Reward Points Functionality on Storefront]** = _Yes_
   * **[!UICONTROL Customers May See Reward Points History]** = _Yes_
   * **[!UICONTROL Refund Reward Points Automatically]** = _No_
   * **[!UICONTROL Deduct Reward Points from Refund Amount Automatically]** = _Yes_
1. Go to the Admin > **[!UICONTROL Store]** > **[!UICONTROL Other Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Reward Exchange Rates]** and click on **[!UICONTROL Add New Rate]**.
1. Add new rate (1:1) and flush the cache.
1. Create a customer and add 10 reward points to this account.
1. Go to the Admin > **[!UICONTROL Sales]** > **[!UICONTROL Orders]** > **[!UICONTROL Create New Order]** > Select the customer created in the previous step.
1. Select any product whose price is greater than the reward points.
1. Place an order via any payment method and the reward points.
1. Create an invoice for the order.
1. Create a credit memo, but do not refund the reward points.

<u>Expected results</u>:

* The Admin can refund the reward points.

* The order status will be closed.
