## Issue

After exporting configurable products, the resulting file cannot be imported again because of a formatting issue with the **[!UICONTROL configurable_variations]** attribute. This happens when there are attribute options which include a comma.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Attributes]** > **[!UICONTROL Product]** and create a new attribute _Size_:
1. Catalog Input Type for Store Owner: **[!UICONTROL Dropdown]**.
  1. Create options that include a comma, e.g.:
      * 10,2cm
      * 15,5cm
1. **[!UICONTROL Advanced Attribute Properties]** - Scope: _Global_.
1. Create a new configurable product using the Create Configurations functionality.
1. Select the above attribute _Size_ and the two options that include the comma.
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL System]** > **[!UICONTROL Data Transfer]** > **[!UICONTROL Export]** and create a new Products export (execute the cron to trigger the generation of the CSV file).
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL System]** > **[!UICONTROL Data Transfer]** > **[!UICONTROL Import]** and try to reimport the same CSV file created above.

<u>Expected results</u>:

User should be able to import file.

<u>Actual results</u>:

```
1. Column configurable_variations: Attribute with code "2cm" does not exist or is missing from product attribute set in row(s): 3
2. Column configurable_variations: Attribute with code "5cm" does not exist or is missing from product attribute set in row(s): 3
3. Column configurable_variations: Invalid option value for attribute "size" in row(s): 3
```
