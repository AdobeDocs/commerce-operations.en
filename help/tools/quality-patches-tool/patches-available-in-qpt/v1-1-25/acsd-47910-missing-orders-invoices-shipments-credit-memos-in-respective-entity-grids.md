## Issue

Missing orders, invoices, shipments, and credit memos in respective entity grids.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Enable **[!UICONTROL Asynchronous indexing]** at **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL Advanced]** > **[!UICONTROL Developer]** > **[!UICONTROL Grid Settings]**.
1. Place two orders.
1. Run the cron to sync those orders to the grid.
1. Open one of the orders and make it ready to be invoiced. DO NOT SUBMIT THE INVOICE YET.
1. Make a new order ready to be placed on the frontend. DO NOT CLICK ON THE PLACE ORDER BUTTON YET.
1. Add a `sleep(30)` in the `foreach` at `NotSyncedDataProvider::L43`.
1. Run `bin/magento cron:run`.
1. Now place the new order.
1. Invoice the previous order.
1. Run the cron again expecting the new order to be synced.
1. Go to the order grid in the Admin.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The new order should appear on the order grid.

<u>Actual results</u>:
