## Issue

The out-of-stock bundled products are not available in the GraphQL response even if the [!UICONTROL Display Out-of-Stock Products] is set to *[!UICONTROL Yes]*.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Go to the Adobe Commerce Admin > **[!UICONTROL System]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** > **[!UICONTROL Inventory]** and set the [!UICONTROL Display Out-of-Stock Products] to *[!UICONTROL Yes]*.
1. Create two simple products, s1 and s2. 
1. Make s1 out-of-stock and not visible individually and s2 in-stock and not visible individually, and assign them to a category.
1. Create a bundled product with at least one option product and assign s1 and s2 to this option (input type "RadioButton").
1. Save the bundled product and assign it to a category.
1. Go to the storefront and open this bundled product. You will see the out-of-stock option s1 is greyed but visible.
1. Send a GraphQL request:

```GraphQL
{
  categoryList(filters: { ids: { in: ["3"] } }) {
    id
    name
    products(pageSize: 8, sort: { position: ASC }) {
      total_count
      items {
        id
        sku
        name
        ... on BundleProduct {
          url_key
          items {
            title
            sku
            options {
              quantity
              position
              is_default
              product {
                id
                name
                sku
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<u>Expected results</u>:

s1 bundle option is listed in the GraphQL response since [!UICONTROL Display Out-of-Stock Products] is set to *[!UICONTROL Yes]*, and it is visible on the storefront.

<u>Actual results</u>:

s1 bundle option is not listed in the GraphQL response.

```GraphQL
"items": [
                                {
                                    "title": "oo1",
                                    "sku": "bundle2",
                                    "options": [
                                        {
                                            "quantity": 1,
                                            "position": 2,
                                            "is_default": false,
                                            "product": {
                                                "id": 2,
                                                "name": "s2",
                                                "sku": "s2"
                                            }
                                        }
                                    ]
                                }
                            ]
```
