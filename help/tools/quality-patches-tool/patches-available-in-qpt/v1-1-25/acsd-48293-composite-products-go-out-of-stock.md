1. Create a configurable product with one associated product using the primary website's stock source (set qty = 1).
1. Place an order for the configurable product.
1. Run the cron.
1. Open the configurable product from the storefront and confirm it is out of stock.
1. Open the configurable product from the [!UICONTROL Admin] and set the **[!UICONTROL Manage Stock Option]** to *[!UICONTROL No]*.
1. Run the cron.
1. Ship the order and add qty to the simple product making it in stock.
