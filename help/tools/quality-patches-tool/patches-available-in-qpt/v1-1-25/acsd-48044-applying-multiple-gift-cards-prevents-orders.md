## Issue

Applying multiple gift cards to a single order with multi-shipping prevents orders from being placed.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Install a clean version of Adobe Commerce.
1. Create a simple product with a price of $100 and another simple product with a price of $10.
1. Log in to the [!UICONTROL Admin panel] and create two gift cards.

    * 02KB8M0H0GRD = $50
    * 00GXM6SUGBLW = $25

1. Create a customer with two addresses.
1. Add two products to the cart.

    * Add the $10 product first, and then add the $100 product. The issue cannot be reproduced if the $100 product is added first.

1. Go to the shopping cart and add the two gift cards you created.
1. Click on **[!UICONTROL Ship to Multiple Addresses]** on the cart page.
1. Assign each product to a different address.
1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Shipping information]** page.
1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Billing information]** page.
1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Review Your Order]** page, where you can see the issue.
1. Try to place the order.

<u>Expected results</u>:

* Gift cards are applied to the total amount correctly.
* Orders are placed.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Gift card amounts are mixed with an error *"Please correct the gift card code."* when placing the order.

* First product:

    * Remove Gift Card (00GXM6SUGBLW) - $15.00
    * Remove Gift Card (02KB8M0H0GRD) - $0.00
