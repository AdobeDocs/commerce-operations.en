## Issue

The error occurs when a product with infinite backorder cannot be ordered from the storefront.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Set the following configuration settings:
    * **[!UICONTROL Display Out of Stock Products]** set to *[!UICONTROL Yes]*.
    * **[!UICONTROL Backorders]** set to *[!UICONTROL Allow Qty Below 0]*.
1. Add a new **[!DNL custom stock]** and **[!DNL custom source]**.
1. Assign a product to the **[!DNL custom source]** and make sure there is an inventory number set for it (For Example: *10*).
1. On the product edit page, open **[!UICONTROL Advanced Inventory]**. Set the **[!UICONTROL minimum quantity]** in the cart, (For Example: *160*). The quantity must be above inventory.
1. Go to the storefront and buy a product to create a reservation.
1. Change the **[!UICONTROL product quantity]** to *0*. The critical point is to save the product from the **[!DNL Admin panel]** when there is a reservation.
1. Open the **[!UICONTROL product page]** on the storefront and try to add the product to the cart.

<u>Expected results</u>:

It's possible to add the product to the cart because backorders for a quantity below *0* are allowed.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The product is displayed to be out of stock.
