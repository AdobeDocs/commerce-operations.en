## Issue

The default shipping address is used instead of the newly added shipping address when placing an order using a negotiable quote.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Enable B2B quote by navigating to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL B2B features]** > **[!UICONTROL Enable company]** > **[!UICONTROL Enable B2B quote]**.
1. Log in as a company user.
1. Add a product to the cart.
1. Go to the cart page and request a quote.
1. Go to the customer's **[!UICONTROL My Quotes]** page and select the quote that was just created.
1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Shipping Information]** section of the customer's quote page.
    * Click **[!UICONTROL Add New Address]**, fill out the form, and save the address (do not select **[!UICONTROL Use as my default billing address]** or **[!UICONTROL Use as my default shipping address]**).
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Send for Review]** on the customer's quote page.
1. Go to the Adobe Commerce Admin as an admin user, open the quote that was just created, and click **[!UICONTROL Send]**.
1. Now go to the customer's quote page, refresh the page, and click **[!UICONTROL Proceed to Checkout]**.
1. On the checkout page, data shows the default shipping address even when the new shipping address is selected.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Continue]** and place the order.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The order should use the new address without reselecting the default shipping address on the checkout page.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The order is placed with the default shipping address.
