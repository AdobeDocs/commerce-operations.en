## Issue

Email confirmation is not translated to the website locale when creating customers using bulk API.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Install a different locale like `de_DE`.
1. Configure *RabbitMQ*.
1. Execute `bin/magento setup:upgrade` to install the queues in RabbitMQ and set up the language pack.
1. Create an additional website in [!UICONTROL Admin] > **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL All Stores]**.
1. Set the locale of this new website to `de_DE` in [!UICONTROL Admin] > **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL General]** > **[!UICONTROL Locale Options]**.
1. Execute an API call to create a customer account using bulk API. Use the corresponding `website_id`. 

    `Endpoint: /rest/async/bulk/V1/customers`

    ```
    [{
        "customer": {
        "email": "test@example.com",
        "firstname": "test",
        "lastname": "test",
        "website_id": 2
        },
        "password": "Passw0rd!"
    }]
    ```

1. Execute `bin/magento queue:consumers:start async.operations.all --single-thread --max-messages=10`.
1. You can see that the customer account is created correctly on the specified website.
1. Check the email received for customer registration.

<u>Expected results</u>:

Since the customer is created on a specified website, the registration email is sent using the locale of that website.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The customer is created correctly on the specified website, but the registration email is sent using the default locale when bulk API is used.
