## Issue

[!DNL JS] errors occur on a [!DNL staging] update page when [!DNL Google Analytics Content Experiments] is enabled.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. In **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL All Stores]**, create an additional website, store, and **[!UICONTROL Store View]**. Make sure the **[!UICONTROL Store View]** is *[!UICONTROL Enabled]*.
1. Configure **[!DNL Configure Google Analytics]** by going to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL Sales]** > **[!UICONTROL Google API]**:
    * For **[!DNL Main]** and additional websites [!DNL scope]:
        * **[!UICONTROL Enabled]**: *[!UICONTROL Yes]*
        * **[!UICONTROL Account type]**: *[!UICONTROL Google Tag Manager]*
        * **[!UICONTROL Anonymize IP]**: *[!UICONTROL Yes]*
        * **[!UICONTROL Enable Content Experiments]**: *[!UICONTROL Yes]*
        * **[!UICONTROL Container Id]**: *[!UICONTROL (GTM container ID)]*
        * **[!DNL Uncheck]** *[!UICONTROL Use Default]* for other fields, but do not change them.
     * For **[!DNL Default Config]** [!DNL scope]:
         * **[!UICONTROL Enabled]**: *[!UICONTROL Yes]*
         * **[!UICONTROL Account type]**: *[!UICONTROL Universal Analytics]*

         * **[!UICONTROL Anonymize IP]**: *[!UICONTROL Yes]*
         * **[!UICONTROL Enable Content Experiments]**: *[!UICONTROL Yes]*
1. Disable **[!DNL Configure Google Analytics]** on **[!DNL Default Config]** [!DNL scope] by changing **[!UICONTROL Enable]** from *[!UICONTROL Yes]* to *[!UICONTROL No]*. Make sure not to change anything else!
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** > **[!UICONTROL Categories]**.
1. Create and Edit any **[!UICONTROL category]** and add a scheduled update for it:
    * Any name, start date in the future, end date in the future, and any change in **[!UICONTROL category]** ([!UICONTROL For Example]: *[!UICONTROL disable category]*).
1. Save the update and check the [!DNL browser developer console] for errors.

<u>Expected results</u>:

No [!DNL JS] errors and the changes to the [!DNL staging] update are saved successfully.
