## Issue

MySQL connection times out when consumer `max_messages = 0`.

However, connection to the database will be restored when starting a transaction.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Send a request to bulk update products using the `async/bulk/V1/products` REST API endpoint.
1. Check status in the `magento_operation` table.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The products are updated.

<u>Actual results</u>:

1. An error is logged:

    ```
    report.CRITICAL: Message has been rejected: SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 2006 MySQL server has gone away [] []
    ```

1. *status* for this operation remains *4* in the `magento_operation` table.
