## Issue

A coupon code, limited for single use per customer, cannot be reused following a failed previous order. 

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Set up a cart price rule with *[!UICONTROL Uses per Customer]* = *1*.
1. Proceed to make a purchase using the assigned coupon code.
1. Cancel the order from the admin panel or execute the order with a payment failure.
1. Run the command: `bin/magento queue:consumers:start sales.rule.update.coupon.usage`  
1. Try to place a subsequent order using the same coupon code for the same customer.

<u>Expected results</u>:

After cancelling the order or encountering a payment failure, the customer can successfully reuse the coupon code for a new purchase.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The customer is not able to reuse the coupon code.
