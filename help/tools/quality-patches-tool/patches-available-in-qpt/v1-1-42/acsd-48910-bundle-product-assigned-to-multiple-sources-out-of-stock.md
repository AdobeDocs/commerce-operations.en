## Issue

The bundled product assigned to multiple sources goes out of stock after invoicing and shipping, even if it's still available.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create two websites.
1. Create two stores/store views (one per website).
1. Create two simple products (qty = 10) and assign them to both stocks and websites.
1. Create a bundled product and add these simple products to it. Assign the bundled product to both websites.
1. Go to the storefront and add the bundled product to the cart.
1. Check out and place the order.
1. From the Admin, invoice and ship the order.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The bundled product stays in stock since we bought only 1 of the 10 items.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The bundled product changes its status to out-of-stock.
