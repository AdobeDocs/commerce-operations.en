## Issue

Customer address export doesn't work when a multi-select **`Customer Address`** attribute without values is created.

<u>Prerequisites</u>:

Create a customer with an address.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a multi-select **`Customer Address`** attribute in **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Customer Addresses]**.
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL System]** > **[!UICONTROL Export]**, and select **`Customer Address`** entity type.
1. Export the customer addresses. You'll see that nothing is exported.
1. Delete the multi-select **`Customer Address`** attribute, and export the customer addresses again. This time the addresses' CSV file is generated.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The customer addresses can be exported as a CSV file when a multi-select **`Customer Address`** attribute is created.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The customer addresses can't be exported as a CSV file when a multi-select **`Customer Address`** attribute is created.
