# BB2B-2598: Adds caching capability to `storeConfig`, `currency`, `country`, `countries`, and `availableStores` GraphQl queries

The BB2B-2598 patch adds caching capability to `storeConfig`, `currency`, `country`, `countries`, and `availableStores` GraphQl queries. This patch is available when the [[!DNL Quality Patches Tool (QPT)]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-operations/tools/quality-patches-tool/quality-patches-tool-to-self-serve-quality-patches) 1.1.30 is installed. The patch ID is BB2B-2598. Please note that the issue is scheduled to be fixed in Adobe Commerce 2.4.7-beta1.

## Affected products and versions

**The patch is created for Adobe Commerce version:**

* Adobe Commerce (all deployment methods) 2.4.4 - 2.4.6 

**Compatible with Adobe Commerce versions:**

* Adobe Commerce (all deployment methods) 2.4.4 - 2.4.6

>[!NOTE]
>
>The patch might become applicable to other versions with new [!DNL Quality Patches Tool] releases. To check if the patch is compatible with your Adobe Commerce version, update the `magento/quality-patches` package to the latest version and check the compatibility on the [[!DNL Quality Patches Tool]: Search for patches page](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/tools/commerce-quality-patches/index.html). Use the patch ID as a search keyword to locate the patch.

## Issue

`availableStores`, `countries`, `country`, `currency`, `storeConfig`, and `customAttributeMetadata` GraphQL queries are not cacheable.

<u>Prerequisites</u>:

* Server is pointing to [!DNL Varnish] proxying to Adobe Commerce backend.
* Config setting `system/full_page_cache/caching_application` is set to *2* ([!DNL Varnish]), or go to Adobe Commerce Admin > **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL System]** > **[!UICONTROL Full Page Cache]** > **[!UICONTROL Caching Application]** > and set it to [!DNL Varnish].

After the patch is applied, run the following steps to ensure caching capability is now available:

1. Send `GET` request to any of the GraphQL queries listed above, using any arbitrary fields.
1. Resend the request without any changes; you will notice that it is much faster. Note that the request is not sent to the backend but it is completely handled by [!DNL Varnish] as a cache hit.
1. If further proof is required, comment out the unset of `X-Magento-Debug` header present in our [VCL](https://github.com/magento/magento2/blob/026e5b29a5edfd619bbdea62d636b3cab2ea03b4/app/code/Magento/PageCache/etc/varnish6.vcl#L227), then restart [!DNL Varnish] and run the above steps again.
