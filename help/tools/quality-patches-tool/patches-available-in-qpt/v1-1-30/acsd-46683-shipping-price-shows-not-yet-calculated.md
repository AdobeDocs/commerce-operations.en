<u>Prerequisites</u>:

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Configure the free shipping delivery method.
1. Configure at least one more delivery method.
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Marketing]** > **[!UICONTROL Cart Price Rules]** and create a new rule:
    * Name = *75more* 
    * Coupon = None
    * Priority = 1
    * Conditions: Subtotal is equal to or greater than *$75*
    * Actions:
        * Apply to Shipping Amount = Yes
        * Discard subsequent rules = No
        * Free Shipping = For shipments with matching items
1. Create another cart price rule:
    * Name = *35off* 
    * Priority = 0
    * Coupon = Specific Coupon
    * Coupon code = 35off
    * Actions:
        * Apply = Percent of product price discount
        * Discount Amount = 35
        * Apply to Shipping Amount = No
        * Discard subsequent rules = Yes
        * Free Shipping = No
1. Open the storefront, and add three products to the cart so the subtotal exceeds $75.
1. Proceed to checkout as a guest.
1. On the shipping step, select **$0 - free shipping** and proceed to the payment step.
1. Check the [!UICONTROL Order Summary] on the payment step. It shows *[!UICONTROL $0 - Free Shipping - Free]*.
