## Issue

The coupon is incorrectly marked as *used* after a failed card payment.

<u>Prerequisites</u>:

1. Configure the **[!UICONTROL Braintree sandbox payment]** method.
1. Make sure the [*sales.rule.update.coupon.usage*](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/configuration-guide/message-queues/consumers.html?lang=en) consumer is set up and running.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a **[!UICONTROL Cart Price Rule]** with auto generated coupon codes. 
1. Log in as a customer.
1. Add product(s) to the cart.
1. Apply an auto generated coupon code.
1. Try to place an order with a failed payment.
1. Check the coupon usage in the **[!UICONTROL Cart Price Rule]** under the **[!UICONTROL Manage Coupon Codes]** tab.

<u>Expected results</u>:

Coupon shouldn't be flagged as *used* if the payment is failed.

<u>Actual results</u>:

* Coupon code says - Used: *Yes*, Times Used: *1*
* Coupon code is valid for a single-time use only.
