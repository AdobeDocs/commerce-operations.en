## Issue

The remote storage synchronization fails because of 0-byte files.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Configure the AWS S3 as the remote storage.
1. Execute `[bin/magento remote-storage:sync]` to make sure the synchronization works properly at the beginning.
1. Create a 0-byte file inside the `[pub/media]`.
1. Execute `[bin/magento remote-storage:sync]` again.

<u>Expected results</u>:

Since the AWS S3 accepts 0-byte files on the S3 direct push, there is no error.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The following error happens:

```PHP
Uploading media files to remote storage.
In File.php line 387:
  The file or directory "pub/media/xxxx.file" cannot be copied to "*.amazonaws.com/media/xxxx.file"
```
