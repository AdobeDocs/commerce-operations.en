## Issue

Product alert emails are not sent when a product is back in stock or the price is changed.

<u>Prerequisites</u>:

Set up product alerts for when a product is added back to stock.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Log in as a customer on the storefront.
1. Open a product that is not in stock.
1. Subscribe to receive a notification when the product is *back in stock*.
1. Update the product from [!UICONTROL Admin] to be _back in stock_.

<u>Expected results</u>:

An email notification about the product being *back in stock* is sent to the customer.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The customer does not receive an email notification about the product being *back in stock*. The following error appears in the log:

```
report. CRITICAL: Magento\ProductAlert\Model\Mailing\ErrorEmailSender::execute(): Argument #2 ($storeId) must be of type int, string given, called in vendor/magento/module-product-alert/Model/Mailing/AlertProcessor.php on line 130 [] []
