## Issue

Performance degradation occurs when fetching bundled products via [!DNL GraphQL].

<u>Prerequisites</u>:

Create 2000 bundle products using the [Performance toolkit](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/configuration-guide/cli/generate-data.html).

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Enable the [!DNL DB] query logger:

    ```
    bin/magento dev:query-log:enable
    ```
    
1. Execute the following [!DNL GraphQL] query:

    ```GraphQL
    {
      products(
        search: "bundle"
        pageSize: 2000,
        sort: { relevance: DESC }
      ) {
        total_count
        items {
          name
          sku
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
1. Check `var/log/db.log` for requests to the `catalog_product_bundle_selection` table.

<u>Expected results</u>:

Requests to the `catalog_product_bundle_selection` table should not be present in the `var/log/db.log`.

<u>Actual results</u>:

There are 2000 requests to `catalog_product_bundle_selection` table which are triggered at the same time, which cause performance degradation.
