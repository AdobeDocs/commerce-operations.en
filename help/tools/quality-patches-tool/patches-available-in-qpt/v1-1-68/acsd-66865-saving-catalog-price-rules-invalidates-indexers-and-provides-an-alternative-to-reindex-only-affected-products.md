## Issue

Saving a **[!UICONTROL Catalog Price Rule]** causes all indexers to be invalidated, triggering full reindexes instead of reindexing only affected products.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Ensure cron isn't running and all indexers are set to update on schedule (except `customer_grid` which can update on save).
2. Run a full manual reindex using the command: `php bin/magento indexer:reindex`.
3. Verify all indexes show status *[!UICONTROL Ready]* with *0* items in the backlog.
4. On the Admin sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Marketing]** > *[!UICONTROL Promotions]* > **[!UICONTROL Catalog Price Rule]**. Create an active catalog price rule for a single product (for example, using a *SKU* condition).
5. Run the command: `php bin/magento indexer:status` to check indexer status.
6. Observe that multiple indexes are marked as **[!UICONTROL Reindex Required]** even though only one product is affected.

<u>Expected results</u>:

Only the affected product data is identified, and a partial reindex is triggered instead of a full reindex across all indexers.

<u>Actual results</u>:

A full reindex is triggered for all indexers, even when only a single product is affected by the **[!UICONTROL Catalog Price Rule]**.
