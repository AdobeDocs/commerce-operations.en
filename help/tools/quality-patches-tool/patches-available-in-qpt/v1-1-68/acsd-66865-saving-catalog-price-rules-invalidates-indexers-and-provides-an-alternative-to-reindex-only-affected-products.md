## Issue

Issue where saving catalog price rules invalidated indexers and provides alternative to reindex only affected products.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Ensure cron is not running and all indexers are set to update on schedule (except customer_grid which can update on save)
2. Execute a full manual reindex using the "php bin/magento indexer:reindex" command.
3. At this point, all indexes should be marked as "ready" with 0 items in the backlog.
4. Create a catalog rule for only one product and ensure it is active (the most obvious one being a rule with a SKU condition.)
5. Execute the "php bin/magento indexer:status" command to check indexer status.
6. Number of indexes are marked as "Reindex required" even though there is only one product affected by the change and is present in the backlog.

<u>Expected results</u>:

Adobe Commerce retrieves only the data that is actually affected and triggers a partial reindex.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Adobe Commerce performs full reindexes for changes that affect only a small portion of the product catalog.
