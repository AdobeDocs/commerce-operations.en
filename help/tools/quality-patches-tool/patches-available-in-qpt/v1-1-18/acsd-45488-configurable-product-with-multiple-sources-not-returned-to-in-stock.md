## Issue

A configurable product with multiple sources is not returned to in stock automatically.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a secondary stock source.
1. Create a configurable product with two associated virtual products.
1. Assign the associated products to the default stock source and set the quantity to one.
1. Check the `stock_status` from `cataloginventory_stock_status`.
1. Set both the associated products to be *out of stock*.
1. Check the `stock_status` from `cataloginventory_stock_status`.
1. Set both associated products to be *in stock*.
1. Check the `stock_status` from `cataloginventory_stock_status`.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The stock status of the configurable product is updated to *in stock* when the associated products are set to be in stock.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The stock status of the configurable product is not updated to *in stock* when the associated products are set to be in stock.
