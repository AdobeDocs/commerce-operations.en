## Issue

A GraphQL `products` mutation for a specific store returns all configurable variants, including those not assigned to the requested store.

<u>Prerequisites</u>:

Create a 2nd website, 2nd store, and a 2nd store view.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a configurable product with two subproducts: "configurable-a" and "configurable-b".
1. Assign the configurable product to both websites.
1. Assign only one "configurable-a" variation to the 2nd website.
1. Go to the **Storefront**, switch to the 2nd website, and open the configurable product.
1. Make sure you see only one child option: "configurable-a".
1. Run a GraphQL query using `POST: /graphql` endpoint, and `Headers: "store" = "new"`

    ```GraphQL
    {
      products(filter: { sku: { eq: "configurable" } }) {
        items {
          id
          attribute_set_id
          name
          sku
          __typename
          price_range{
            minimum_price{
              regular_price{
                value
                currency
              }
            }
          }
          categories {
            id
          }
          ... on ConfigurableProduct {
            configurable_options {
              id
              attribute_id_v2
              label
              position
              use_default
              attribute_code
              values {
                value_index
                label
              }
              product_id
            }
            variants {
              product {
                id
                name
                sku
                attribute_set_id
                ... on PhysicalProductInterface {
                  weight
                }
                price_range{
                  minimum_price{
                    regular_price{
                      value
                      currency
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
              attributes {
                uid
                label
                code
                value_index
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

<u>Expected results</u>:

The "configurable-b" variation is not assigned to the 2nd website and should not be displayed in the response.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The "configurable-b" variation is displayed in the response.
