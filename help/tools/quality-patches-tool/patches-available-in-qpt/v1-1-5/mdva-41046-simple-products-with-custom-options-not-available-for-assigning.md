## Issue

Simple products with custom options are not available for assigning to configurable/grouped product.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a simple product with customizable options and set a value for the configurable attribute.
    * Use *Color* as the configurable attribute, and select *Yellow* as the color value.
1. Save the simple product.
1. Now go to the create configurable product page.
1. Go through the "Create configuration" wizard and make sure to select *Yellow* as the attribute color.
1. Without saving the configurable product, select  "Choose different product" option from the Select dropdown.
1. This will open a product grid that is filtered by color attribute yellow. Now select the simple product that was created previously with customizable options.
1. Save the configurable product.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The simple product with custom options is available for assigning (visible in grid) in step 6.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Configuration section is empty.
