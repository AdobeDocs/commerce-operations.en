## Issue

Users are unable to create new schedules or edit existing ones for products if the "End Date" has been previously removed.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a product with the Status set to *disable*.
1. Add a scheduled update to enable this product.
    * Add future start and end dates.
1. Edit the scheduled update by removing the **End Date**.
1. Edit the schedule again and try to add an **End Date**. An error will occur.
1. Refresh the page and again go to **Edit Scheduled Update**.
1. Click **Remove from update** > **Delete the update**.
1. Now you should not see the scheduled update on top of the product edit page.
1. Try to create a new scheduled update overlapping the previous duration.

<u>Expected results</u>:

* There is no error in step 4. The admin is able to update the scheduled update without any error as the schedule is not yet active.
* The admin user is able to delete the previous update and create a new one.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Users get the following error message:

*error: Future Update already exists in this time range. Set a different range and try again.*
