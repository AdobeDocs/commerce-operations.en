## Issue

When `catalogrule_product` partial indexer is executed on configurable products, catalog rules get disappeared.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Log in to the Admin backend.
1. Go to **Stores** > **Attributes** > **Product** and search for the "manufacturer" attribute.
    * Add a few options and set "Use for Promo Rule Conditions" to *Yes*.
1. Go to **Stores** > **Attributes** > **Attribute Sets**.
    * Select the default attribute set and add the "manufacturer" attribute to it.
1. Create a configurable product with a couple of variations.
1. Set "manufacturer" attribute value for previously created configurable product.
1. Create catalog rules:
    * Active = Yes
    * Websites = Main Website
    * Customer Groups = NOT LOGGED IN
    * Conditions: manufacturer = \<selected value for configurable product>
    * Actions: Any discount
1. Do a full index.
1. Check product price on PDP and make sure the price is correct.
1. Update the "weight" attribute of the created configurable product.
1. Check product price on PDP.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The catalog price rules set on configurable products are not removed during partial reindex.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The catalog price rules set on configurable products are disappeared during partial reindex.
