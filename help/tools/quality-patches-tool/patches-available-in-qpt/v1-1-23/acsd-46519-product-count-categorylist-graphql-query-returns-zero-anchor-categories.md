Use the patch ID as a search keyword to locate the patch.

## Issue

When the [!UICONTROL categoryList] [!DNL GraphQL] method is used to get child categories it shows the [!UICONTROL product_count] as 0 for parent categories.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Use the following [!DNL GraphQL] request to get the category hierarchy with [!UICONTROL product_count]:

<pre><code>
{
  categoryList(filters: { ids: { eq: "2" } }) {
    id
    name
    product_count
    level
    children {
      name
      product_count
      level
      children {
        name
        product_count
        level
        children {
          name
          product_count
          level
          children {
            name
            product_count
            level
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<u>Expected results</u>:

If the parent category is an anchored category, then the [!UICONTROL product_count] should show the sum of child category product counts on every level.

<u>Actual results</u>:

If the parent category is an anchored category, then the products are shown as 0 for category level 2 and downwards.
