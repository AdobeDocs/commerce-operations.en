## Issue

The slow query B2B [!UICONTROL CompanyRole] [!DNL GraphQL] update does not work as expected.

<u>Prerequisites</u>:

Install the B2B module.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. In the Adobe Commerce Admin, go to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Configurations]** > **[!UICONTROL B2B Features]** and set **[!UICONTROL Enable Company]** to _Yes_.
1. Go to the frontend and create a company.
1. After you log in as a company user, go to **[!UICONTROL My Account]** > **[!UICONTROL Roles and Permissions]** and add a new role.
1. Enable [!UICONTROL dev] query log using `bin/magento dev:que:enab`.
1. Now send the below [!DNL GraphQL] request (id is the [!UICONTROL base64] encoded role id):

   <pre><code>
   mutation {
   updateCompanyRole(
      input: {
         id: "Mg=="
         permissions: [
         "Magento_Company::view"
         "Magento_Company::view_account"
         "Magento_Company::user_management"
         "Magento_Company::roles_view"
        ]
      }
    ) {
      role {
         id

         name

         permissions {
         id

         text

         children {
            id

            text

            children {
               id

               text
             }
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   </code></pre>

1. Check the query log.
1. You can see that the above query is executed. This query is executed in `app/code/Magento/CompanyGraphQl/Model/Company/Role/ValidateRole.php::validateResources`.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The `app/code/Magento/CompanyGraphQl/Model/Company/Role/ValidateRole.php::validateResources` needs to be optimized to avoid loading all the data available in the **[!UICONTROL company_permissions]** DB table.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Adobe Commerce executes a query without any filter. When there are a large number of records, it takes a lot of time for Adobe Commerce to prepare the data collection.
