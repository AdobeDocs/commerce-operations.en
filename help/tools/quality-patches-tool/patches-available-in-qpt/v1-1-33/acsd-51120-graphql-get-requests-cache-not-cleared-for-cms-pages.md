## Issue

GraphQL GET request cache is not cleared for CMS pages that contain CMS blocks that are updated via a staging update.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a CMS block.
1. Include the CMS block into a CMS page using the [!DNL Page Builder].
1. Fetch the CMS page using the given GraphQL query using a GET request: 

    ```GraphQL
    {
    cmsPage( identifier: "<CMS PAGE IDENTIFIER>") {
        content
        content_heading
        identifier
        meta_description
        meta_keywords
        meta_title
        page_layout
        title
        url_key
    }
    }
    ```

1. Make sure the GraphQL response is cached in [!DNL Varnish].
1. Create a scheduled update for the block.
1. Wait for the scheduled update to apply and run the cron job to apply the scheduled update.
1. Fetch the CMS page again using the given GraphQL query using a GET request.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The response shows the updated content.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The response still shows the old content.
