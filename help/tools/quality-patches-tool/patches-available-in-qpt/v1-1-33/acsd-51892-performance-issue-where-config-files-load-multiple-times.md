# ACSD-51892: Performance issue where config files load multiple times

The ACSD-51892 patch fixes the performance issue that arises from loading the `app/etc/env.php` and `app/etc/config.php` files each time deployment configuration values are accessed within a single request. The excessive file reading puts strain on the system, leading to a deterioration in overall performance. This patch is available when the [!DNL Quality Patches Tool (QPT)] 1.1.33 is installed. The patch ID is ACSD-51892. Please note that the issue was fixed in Adobe Commerce 2.4.6-p2.

## Affected products and versions

**The patch is created for Adobe Commerce version:**

* Adobe Commerce (all deployment methods) 2.4.6

**Compatible with Adobe Commerce versions:**

* Adobe Commerce (all deployment methods) 2.4.6 - 2.4.6-p1

>[!NOTE]

>The patch might become applicable to other versions with new [!DNL Quality Patches Tool] releases.

## Issue

There is a performance issue where the config files load multiple times.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Perform deployment or upgrade to Adobe Commerce 2.4.6 or later.
1. Check filesystem logs for access to `app/etc/env.php` and `app/etc/config.php` files while deployment is running.

<u>Expected results</u>:

Deployment is successful within the regular timeframe.

<u>Actual results</u>:

* The servers are struggling to respond to any commands you enter. This results in *Error 503 first byte timeout* when accessing the website.
* There are multiple entries in log files with access to `app/etc/env.php` and `app/etc/config.php` files.
