<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a new stock.
1. Create a new source.
1. Assign the default website to the new stock and assign the new source.
1. Create a new product.

    * Set the default source Qty to 10 and the new source Qty to 0.

1. Observe the backorder warning on checkout, indicating that the product is coming from a new source.
1. Place the order.
1. Open the order in Admin, and check the backorder status.

<u>Expected results</u>:
