## Issue

A customer is unable to sort a catalog page by a custom attribute of the type *Dropdown*.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>

1. Create about six simple products and assign them to a single category.
1. Create a product attribute in order to add it as a sorting option on the listing pages.

    * Go to **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Attributes]** > **[!UICONTROL Add New Attribute]**.
    * In the **[!UICONTROL Properties]** tab, set the following:

        * *[!UICONTROL Default Label]* = *test*
        * *[!UICONTROL Catalog Input Type]* for Store Owner = *Dropdown*
        * *[!UICONTROL Options]*:

            * *first*
            * *second*
            * *third*
            * *fourth*

    * In the **[!UICONTROL Storefront Properties]** tab, set the following:

        * *[!UICONTROL Used for sorting in product listing]* = *Yes*
        * Leave all the other options as *Default*.

1. Assign the *test* attribute to the *Default* attribute set in **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Attributes]** > **[!UICONTROL Attribute Set]**.
1. Configure the products to have *test* attribute values.

    * SKU: s00001, test: fourth
    * SKU: s00002, test: third
    * SKU: s00003, test: second
    * SKU: s00004, test: first
    * SKU: s00005, test: fourth
    * SKU: s00006, test: third

1. Reindex and clear cache.
1. Go to the category on the storefront.
1. Sort by the *test* attribute.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The products are sorted by the *test* attribute.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The products are not sorted by the *test* attribute.
