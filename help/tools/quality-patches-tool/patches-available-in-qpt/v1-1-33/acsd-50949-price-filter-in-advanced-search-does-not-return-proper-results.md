The price filter in advanced search does not return proper results when used along with the SKU filter.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

    | SKU | Name      | Price | Quantity |
    |-----|-----------|-------|----------|
    | MJ1 | Product 1 | $10   | 10       |
    | MJ2 | Product 2 | $15   | 10       |
    | MJ3 | Product 3 | $21   | 10       |
    | MJ4 | Product 4 | $32   | 10       |
    | MJ5 | Product 5 | $33   | 10       |
    | MJ6 | Product 6 | $34   | 10       |
    | MJ7 | Product 7 | $44   | 10       |

1. Open the **[!UICONTROL Advanced Search]** on the Storefront and search by SKU: "MJ".
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Modify your search]** link.
1. Add a price range to the criteria from *1* to *21*, and click the **[!UICONTROL Search]** button.
