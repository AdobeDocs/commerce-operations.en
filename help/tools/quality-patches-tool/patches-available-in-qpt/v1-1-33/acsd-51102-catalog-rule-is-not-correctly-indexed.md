## Issue

A catalog rule that is applied to a large number of products is not correctly indexed when the rule is enabled by a scheduled update.

Prerequisites:

* Cron job is set up and runs every minute.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a large catalog with thousands of products to achieve the running time for the *catalog rule* indexers of more than 120 seconds when catalog rules are being enabled.
2. Create two catalog rules with *Active* status set to *No*.  For example, *Test 1* and *Test 2*. Each rule should affect all products in the catalog and cause the indexer to run for more than 120 seconds.
3. Make sure the status of the indexer is *Ready*.
4. Create scheduled updates to enable these two rules. *Test 2* schedule should start shortly after *Test 1*. For example, with a 1-minute difference.
5. Check the product prices on the Storefront.

<u>Expected results</u>

Discounts from both rules are applied.

<u>Actual results</u>

Only the first rule discount is applied.
