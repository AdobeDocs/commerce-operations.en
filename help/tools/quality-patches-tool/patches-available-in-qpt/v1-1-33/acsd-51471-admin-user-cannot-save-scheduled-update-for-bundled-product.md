## Issue

Admin users cannot save a scheduled update for a bundled product that uses a simple product that itself has a scheduled update.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Add a scheduled update for the simple product with only the *Start Date* and no *End Date*.
1. After the update is applied, change the SKU of the product.
1. Create a bundled product and add the simple product created in Step 1 as a child product.
1. Create a scheduled update for the bundled product to enable the bundled product. Provide both *Start Date* and *End Date* for the scheduled update.
1. Save the scheduled update.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The scheduled update is successfully saved.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The following error occurs when saving the scheduled update: *The product that was requested doesn't exist. Verify the product and try again.*
