## Issue

JS issue for the rollback action in the Backups grid and the database rollback command for a case when the DB dump contains triggers and a *delimiter* SQL command. 

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Set indexers to [!UICONTROL Update on Schedule] mode so that triggers are created in the database.
1. Enable the backup functionality from the command line:

   `bin/magento config:set system/backup/functionality_enabled 1`

1. Go to **System** > **Tools** > **Backups** and generate a DB backup.
1. Open the browser console; you will see the following error: 

   ```
   Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '&' (at (index):606:32)

   function eventListener8jtGaqtgG2 () {

           return backup.rollback(&#039;db&#039;, &#039;1678391644&#039;);
   ``` 

1. Try to import the DB from the command line:

   `bin/magento setup:rollback --db-file="<filename>"`

1. The following error appears:

   ```
   Syntax error or access violation: 1064 You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MariaDB server version for the right syntax to use near 'delimiter' at line 1, query was: delimiter ;;
   ```
   
<u>Expected results</u>:

The database restoration is successful from both the Admin and the command line.

<u>Actual results</u>:

You observed the errors mentioned in step 4 and step 6.
