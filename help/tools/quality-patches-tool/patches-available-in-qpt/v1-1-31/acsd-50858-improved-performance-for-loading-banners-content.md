## Issue

Banner performance is impacted in the cart/checkout page due to *excessive DB queries and increased page loading time*.

This was fixed by refactoring the way banners' contents are loaded, which reduced the number of DB queries by 99.99% and the page loading time by ~99%.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Log in to Admin and create a simple product.
1. Create a customer, either from Admin or from the frontend, and add a shipping address for it.
1. Move banners.php to the `magento_root/pub/` folder.
1. Generate banners using the  `php pub/banners.php` command. It will generate 10,000 simple banners and 1,000 banners with sales rules.
1. Log in to the customer created previously on the frontend.
1. Add the product created previously to the cart.
1. Go to the checkout page (checkout/cart).
1. Monitor the `banner/ajax/load` request loading time:

    * Without `bin/magento dev:query-log:enable`
    * With `bin/magento dev:query-log:enable`

        ```
        grep 'magento_banner_content' var/debug/db.log  | wc -l
        ```

<u>Expected results</u>:

Decrease in the number of DB queries for `magento_banner_content` and cart/checkout page loading time.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Increase in the number of DB queries for `magento_banner_content` and cart/checkout page loading time.
