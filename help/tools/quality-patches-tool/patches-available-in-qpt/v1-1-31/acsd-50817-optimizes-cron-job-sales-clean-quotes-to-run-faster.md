# ACSD-50817: Optimizes cron job `sales_clean_quotes` to run faster

The ACSD-50817 patch optimizes the cron job `sales_clean_quotes` to run faster by adding a composite index on the `store_id` and `updated_at` columns in the quote table. This patch is available when the [!DNL Quality Patches Tool (QPT)] 1.1.31 is installed. The patch ID is ACSD-50817.

## Issue

The cron job `sales_clean_quotes` is too slow. With this patch, it has been optimized to run faster by adding a composite index on the `store_id` and `updated_at` columns in the quote table.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Generate 50-80M of quotes with `updated_at` set as < 30 days period.
1. Run the cron job `sales_clean_quotes` or the following query on the quote table:

    ```cron
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `quote` AS `main_table` WHERE (`store_id` = '1') AND (`updated_at` <= '2023-02-25') AND (`is_persistent` = '0')

    SELECT * FROM `quote` AS `main_table` WHERE (`store_id` = '1') AND (`updated_at` <= '2023-02-25') AND (`is_persistent` = '0') LIMIT 50
    ```
    
<u>Expected results</u>

Cron job `sales_clean_quotes` is optimized to run faster by adding a composite index on the `store_id` and `updated_at` columns in the quote table.

<u>Actual results</u>

The query is too slow.
