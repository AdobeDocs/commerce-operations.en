## Issue

**Case #1**

1. Enable the **[!UICONTROL reCAPTCHA]** for checkout.
1. Try to place an order without clicking on **[!UICONTROL reCAPTCHA]**.
1. Once the user receives the error message for the missing reCAPTCHA (*reCAPTCHA validation failed, please try again*), click on the **[!UICONTROL reCAPTCHA]** and then try placing an order.

<u>Expected results</u>

The order will not be placed with an incorrect reCAPTCHA.

<u>Actual results</u>

An error is thrown - *reCAPTCHA validation failed, please try again* and *No such cart with id = 4*

Google reCAPTCHA v3 Invisible is not working on checkout, and the order cannot be placed. `PlaceOrder` event is not triggered.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>

1. Configure the **[!UICONTROL reCAPTCHA v3 Invisible]** from the **[!UICONTROL Store]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL Security]**.
1. Enable **[!UICONTROL reCAPTCHA v3 Invisible]** for checkout/placing an order under the **[!UICONTROL Storefront]** tab.
1. Try to place an order with the [!UICONTROL Check/Money order] payment method.

<u>Expected results</u>

The order should be placed with the **[!UICONTROL reCAPTCHA]** turned on.

<u>Actual results</u>
