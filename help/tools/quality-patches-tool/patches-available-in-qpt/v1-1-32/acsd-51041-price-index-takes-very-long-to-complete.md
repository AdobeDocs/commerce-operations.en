## Issue

With a very large product set, the price index takes a very long time to complete. 

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Enable the *[!UICONTROL Inventory]* module.
1. Have multiple stock sources (with a non-default source providing most of the stock).
1. Generate ~200k products.
1. Run an inventory index.

<u>Expected results</u>:

`deleteIndexData` processes only the unique IDs to optimize performance.

<u>Actual results</u>:

`deleteIndexData` processes all IDs, which takes a long time to complete.
