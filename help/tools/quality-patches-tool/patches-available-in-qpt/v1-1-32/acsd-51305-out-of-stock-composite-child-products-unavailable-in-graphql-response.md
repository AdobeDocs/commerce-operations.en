## Issue

Out-of-stock composite child products are not available in the GraphQL response.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Log in to the Admin website.
1. Create a category (cat1, id=3).
1. Create a *simple1* product (out of stock, not visible individually, assigned to *cat1*).
1. Create a *simple2* product (in stock, not visible individually, assigned to *cat1*).
1. Create a *bundle1* product with *simple1* and *simple2* child products as radio-button *option1* products and assign it to the *cat1* category.
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL System]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** > **[!UICONTROL Inventory]**. 

    * Set **[!UICONTROL Display Out of Stock Products]** to *Yes*.

1. Open the *bundle1* product on the storefront, and ensure that both *simple1* and *simple2* child products are displayed inside it.
1. Run the following GraphQL query:

    ```GraphQL
    {
        categoryList(filters: { ids: { in: ["3"] } }) {
            id
            name
            products(pageSize: 8, sort: { position: ASC }) {
                total_count
                items {
                    id
                    sku
                    name
                    ... on BundleProduct {
                        url_key
                        items {
                            title
                            sku
                            options {
                                quantity
                                position
                                is_default
                                product {
                                    id
                                    name
                                    sku
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```
