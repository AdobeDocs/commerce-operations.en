## Issue

A restricted admin with access to one website can add images/videos to a product assigned to multiple websites.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>

1. Log in as an admin.
1. Create a second website, store, and store view.
1. Create a second admin role with resources only for the second website, store, and store view.
1. Create a second admin, and assign it to the new restricted admin role.
1. Create a new product, and assign it to both the default and the new websites.
1. Log out from the main admin profile.
1. Log in as the new restricted admin.
1. Edit the created product, which has been assigned to both websites.
1. Open the **[!UICONTROL Images and Videos]** tab.

<u>Expected results</u>:

* The following message is displayed:

    *Restricted admin is allowed to perform actions with images or videos, only when the admin has rights to all websites which the product is assigned to.* 

* The **[!UICONTROL Add Video]** button is not active.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The restricted admin can add images and videos even when the product is assigned to a website that it does not have access to.
