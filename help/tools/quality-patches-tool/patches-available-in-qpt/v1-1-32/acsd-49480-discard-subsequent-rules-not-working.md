## Issue

[!UICONTROL Cart Price Rule - Discard Subsequent Rules] is not working as intended.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a **[!UICONTROL Cart Price Rule]** with a coupon code (name it as *TEST*) that gives a $10 discount to the *Product ID 1* in the **[!UICONTROL Actions]** tab with [!UICONTROL Discard Subsequent Rules] set to *[!UICONTROL Yes]* and [!UICONTROL Priority] set to *1*.
1. Create another **[!UICONTROL Cart Price Rule]** without a coupon code that gives a $5 discount to *Product ID 2* in the **[!UICONTROL Actions]** tab with [!UICONTROL Priority] set to *2*. Here, we assume, this is a global sale for *Product ID 2*.
1. Go to the frontend site and add *Product ID 1* and *Product ID 2* into the cart.
1. Apply the *TEST* coupon code.

<u>Expected results</u>

* *Discount 1* is applied to *Product ID 1*.
* *Discount 2* is applied to *Product ID 2*.

<u>Actual results</u>

* Only *Discount 1* is applied to *Product ID 1*.
* *Discount 2* is not applied to *Product ID 2*.
