## Issue

The different behaviors on snake_case formatting.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Test the `\Magento\Framework\Api\DataObjectHelper::populateWithArray` function with a variety of different property names.
1. The properties with names like *NewPName* should be transformed into *new_p_name*, instead they're being transformed to *new_pname*.
1. Also, when using the *getNewPName* function in the object, *null* will be returned because the *Abstract model* will correctly transform the call to *new_p_name* making both functions incompatible with each other.

<u>Expected results</u>

The **[!UICONTROL populateWithArray]** function should transform the object properties to snake_case correctly, making it compatible with the **[!DNL AbstractModel's]** `Getters` and `Setters`.

<u>Actual results</u>

When using the **[!UICONTROL populateWithArray]** function, any object properties that contain two or more capital letters in a row in its name will cause the snake_case transformation to be incorrect in the final data array.
