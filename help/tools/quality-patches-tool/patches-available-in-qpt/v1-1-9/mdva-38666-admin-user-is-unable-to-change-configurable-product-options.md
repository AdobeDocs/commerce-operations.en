## Issue

Admin user is not able to change the configurable product options in the customer's cart.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Set customer account scope to Global.
1. Create two websites with stores.
1. Create two configurable products and assign them to each website.
1. Create a customer account in the frontend and log in.
1. Add a product to the cart and do a checkout (this is done to make quote ids different on each website).
1. Add a product to the cart and leave it.
1. Switch to the second website and add the product to the cart (the same login should work since the customer account scope is set to Global).
1. Open the customer from the admin and navigate to the cart tab.
1. Switch the store from the drop-down and try to change the configuration.

<u>Expected results</u>:

User gets a popup with configurable options.

<u>Actual results</u>:

No popup form appears. The user is unable to change the configuration.
