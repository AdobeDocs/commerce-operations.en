## Issue

A new company registration email is sent each time an existing company is updated via REST API.

<u>Prerequisites</u>:

B2B modules installed.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a company account.
1. Use `/V1​/company​/<company_id>` endpoint. To update the created company, see [update the company](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/b2b/company-object.html#update-the-company) in our developer documentation. Below is a sample payload:

```php
{
    "company": {
        "id": 2,
        "status": 1,
        "company_name": "Company",
        "company_email": "company@example.test",
        "street": [
            "Test"
        ],
        "city": "Test",
        "country_id": "US",
        "region_id": "1",
        "postcode": "12345",
        "telephone": "8009994301",
        "customer_group_id": 2,
        "sales_representative_id": 1,
        "super_user_id": 2
    }
}
```

<u>Expected results</u>:

No email is sent saying "New company registration request" as the API is updating an existing company.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Email is sent saying "New company registration request" each time the API request is sent.
