## Issue

GraphQL query of `categoryList` returns both assigned and unassigned categories.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create two categories, CAT1 and CAT2, and assign few products to each category.
1. Create a private shared catalog.
1. Create a company user and assign it to the created shared catalog.
1. Assign CAT1 to the custom catalog and set the category permission to "Allow" Browsing Category for the customer group of the private catalog.
1. Set the category permission for CAT2 to "Deny" Browsing Category for the customer group of private catalog.
1. Run the `categoryList` or `categories` GraphQL query as the company user.

<u>Expected results</u>:

Only the CAT1 shows up in the response.

<u>Actual results</u>:

All the categories show up in the response regardless of the browsing permissions of category.
