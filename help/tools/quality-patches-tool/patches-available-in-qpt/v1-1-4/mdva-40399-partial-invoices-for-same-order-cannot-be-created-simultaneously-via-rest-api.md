## Issue

Partial invoices for the same orders cannot be created simultaneously using Rest API.

<u>Prerequisites</u>:

A configurable product with at least two variations.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Add both variants of the configurable product to the cart.
1. Place the order.
1. Create two invoices simultaneously for the order via the Rest API.

<u>Expected results</u>:

* Both invoices must be created successfully.
* `qty_invoiced` should be updated for both invoices in the `sales_order_item` table.
* Both products should have invoiced quantity.

<u>Actual results</u>:

* Both invoices are created successfully.
* `qty_invoiced` is not updated against one of the invoices in the `sales_order_item` table.
* In the Admin's **Order View** page, the invoices quantity is displayed only for one product.
