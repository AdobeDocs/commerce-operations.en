## Issue

An internal error occurs on requesting cart details from GraphQL for an out-of-stock configurable product.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a configurable product with a few options.
1. Add an option for the above configurable product to the cart from the frontend (guest checkout).
1. Get the `[ masked_id ]` from the `[ quote_id_mask ]` db table for the above created quote.
1. Execute the following GraphQL query to get the above guest cart details. 
    
    Add the `[ masked_id ]` received from step 3 in the query.

    ```GraphQL 
    {
        cart(cart_id: "masked_id") {
            items {
                product {
                    name
                    sku
                }
                ... on ConfigurableCartItem {
                    configurable_options {
                        configurable_product_option_uid
                        option_label
                        configurable_product_option_value_uid
                        value_label
                    }
                }
                quantity
                errors {
                    code
                    message
                }
            }
        }
    }   
    ```

1. This will return the quote details without any issues.
1. Go to the backend and update the configurable product's *[!UICONTROL Stock Status]* to *[!UICONTROL Out of Stock]*.
1. Execute the same GraphQL query, as done in step 4.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The error message is sent/treated correctly in the response.

<u>Actual results</u>:

*500 Internal Server* error is thrown in response to the GraphQL query.
