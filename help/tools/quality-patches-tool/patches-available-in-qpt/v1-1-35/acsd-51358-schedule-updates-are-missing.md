## Issue

The changes in scheduled update without an end date lead to removing other scheduled updates on the same entity.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a **[!UICONTROL scheduled update]** without the end date (*update 1*).
1. Create new **[!UICONTROL scheduled update]** with same start date as first update, but add the next day, and the end date (*update 2*).
1. Edit **[!UICONTROL scheduled update]** created on step 1 (*update 1*) and the save changes.

<u>Expected results</u>

The (*update 2*) should remain in the **[!UICONTROL schedule update]** list when (*update 1*) is edited.

<u>Actual results</u>

The (*update 2*) was removed from the **[!UICONTROL schedule update]** list when (*update 1*) is edited.
