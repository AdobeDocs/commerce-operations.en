## Issue

The `manage_stock` value is incorrectly set to 0 in the CSV file after product export.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Store]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** > **[!UICONTROL Inventory]** > **[!UICONTROL Product Stock Options]** and set **[!UICONTROL Manage Stock]** = *[!UICONTROL No]*.
1. Create a new product and save it.
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL System]** > **[!UICONTROL Export]**.
1. Select *[!UICONTROL Entity Type]* = *[!UICONTROL Products]* and export the products.
1. Check the generated CSV file: `manage_stock` = 0, `use_config_manage_stock` = 1.
1. Again go to **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Store]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** > **[!UICONTROL Inventory]** > **[!UICONTROL Product Stock Options]**, and set  **[!UICONTROL Manage Stock]** = *[!UICONTROL Yes]*.
1. Go to **System** > **Export**.
Select *[!UICONTROL Entity Type]* = *[!UICONTROL Products and export the products]*.
1. Check the generated CSV file: `manage_stock` = 0, `use_config_manage_stock` = 1.
1. Open the product in the Admin, go to **[!UICONTROL Advanced Inventory]** and check the **[!UICONTROL Manage Stock]** value.

<u>Expected results</u>

The **[!UICONTROL Manage Stock]** value is *1* when it is enabled for the products.

<u>Actual results</u>

The **[!UICONTROL Manage Stock]** value is *0* when it is enabled for the products.
