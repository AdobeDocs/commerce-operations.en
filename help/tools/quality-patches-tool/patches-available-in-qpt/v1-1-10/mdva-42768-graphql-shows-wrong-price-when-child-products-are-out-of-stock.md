## Issue

When the child products of a configurable product are out of stock and the Display Out of Stock Products setting is enabled, GraphQL query shows the regular price of the product as **0**.

<u>Prerequisites</u>:

Sample data is installed.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Enable the Display Out of Stock product setting in the Commerce Admin by going to **Stores** > **Configuration** > **Catalog** > **Inventory**.
1. Create a configurable product and assign a simple child product to it.
1. Set the inventory of the variant (simple) product to **Out of Stock**.
1. Reindex.
1. Execute the below GraphQL query:

    ```GraphQL
    query {
      products(filter: { sku: { eq: "MH01" } }) {
        items {
          sku
          price_range {
            minimum_price {
              regular_price {
                value
                currency
              }
              final_price {
                value
                currency
              }
              discount {
                amount_off
                percent_off
              }
            }
            maximum_price {
              regular_price {
                value
                currency
              }
              final_price {
                value
                currency
              }
              discount {
                amount_off
                percent_off
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
1. Check the response section `minimum_price` > `regular price`.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The minimum regular price is not displayed as 0 in response.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The minimum regular price = 0 in response.
