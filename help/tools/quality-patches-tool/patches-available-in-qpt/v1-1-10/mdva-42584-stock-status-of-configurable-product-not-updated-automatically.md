## Issue

Stock status of the configurable product in the backend is not updated automatically when its simple product is set to **In Stock** through API or import.

<u>Prerequisites</u>:

MSI installed.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a configurable product, **InvCheck001**, with two options: **InvCheck001-M** and **InvCheck001-L**.
1. Both the simple products should have Quantity and they should be **In Stock** so that the configurable product is also **In Stock** in the backend.
1. Now, update both simple products and set Quantity to **0** and Stock Status to **Out of Stock**.
1. Refresh the configurable product and verify the stock status is updated to **Out of Stock**.
1. Use the following API endpoint and set the simple product **InvCheck001-M** to **In Stock** with Quantity > 0.

    ```JSON
    /rest/V1/inventory/source-items

    {
      "sourceItems":
      [
        {
          "sku": "InvCheck001-M",
          "source_code": "default",
          "quantity": 10,
          "status": 1
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    
1. Go to the backend and verify the quantity and stock status of the simple product **InvCheck001-M**. It is updated to **In stock**.
1. Refresh the configurable product and check the stock status.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The stock status of the configurable product **InvCheck001** in the backend is updated automatically to **In Stock**.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The stock status of the configurable product is still **Out of Stock**.
