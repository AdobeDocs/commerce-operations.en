## Issue

Related product rules show products from categories not defined in the rule.

<u>Prerequisites</u>:

Install sample data.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create an attribute brand and add it to the **Tops Attribute Set**.
1. Choose **Josie**, **Augusta**, and **Ingrid** jackets to add to the Brand Kitty from **Women** > **Tops** > **Jackets category**.
1. Choose **Beaumont**, **Hyperion**, and **Kenobi** jackets to add to the Brand Kitty from **Men** > **Tops** > **Jacket category**.
1. Create a related product with:

    ```markdown
    Apply To: Related Products
    Customer Segments: All
    ```

    * Products to Match:

    ```markdown
    If ALL of these conditions are TRUE
      Category is {}
      Brand is {}
    ```

    * Products to Display:

    ```markdown
    If ALL of these conditions are TRUE
       Product Category is the same as Matched Product Category
       Product brand is Matched Product Brand
    ```

1. Open SKU WJ04 from the front end and check related products.
