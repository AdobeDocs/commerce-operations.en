## Issue

Changing the product visibility of the second website creates a URL rewrite for the main website.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create an additional Website, Store, and Storeview.
1. Create a simple product.
1. Set the visibility to **Not Visible Individually**.
1. Assign product to the second website only.
1. Fill in all other required fields.
1. Save the product.
1. Start MySQL queues:

    ```mysql
    bin/magento queue:consumers:start product_action_attribute.update &
    bin/magento queue:consumers:start product_action_attribute.website.update &
    ```

1. Go to Product List.
1. Select the created product and update visibility attribute by using the mass update to Catalog and Search.
1. Check the URL rewrite.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The rewrite is created for the second website where the product is assigned to.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The rewrite is created for the main website.
