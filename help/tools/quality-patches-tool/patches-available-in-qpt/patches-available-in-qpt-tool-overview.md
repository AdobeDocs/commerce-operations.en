# Patches available in QPT tool overview

This article provides an overview of [!DNL Quality Patches Tool] (QPT) and links to resources explaining how to use it.

## Affected products and versions

* Adobe Commerce on-premises, all [supported versions](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/cc/en/legal/terms/enterprise/pdfs/Adobe-Commerce-Software-Lifecycle-Policy.pdf)
* Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure, all [supported versions](https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/cc/en/legal/terms/enterprise/pdfs/Adobe-Commerce-Software-Lifecycle-Policy.pdf)

## What is the Quality Patches Tool?

The [[!DNL Quality Patches Tool]](https://github.com/magento/quality-patches) (QPT) is a tool allowing you to apply individual quality patches developed by Adobe and the Magento Open Source community.

It allows you to:

* apply quality patches included to the package
* revert previously applied patches
* view the general information about quality patches available for the installed version of Adobe Commerce.

Here's an example of the status table you can get to view the available patches:

The tool is aimed to enable you to self-serve with patches for issues you might experience with Adobe Commerce, or easily apply patches suggested by Adobe Commerce support.

>[!NOTE]

>QPT is for quality patches only. Security patches are available in the [Release notes for Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/release/notes/overview.html).
