## Issue

**Used** and **Times Used** attributes display incorrect values for generated coupons.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create **[!UICONTROL Cart Price Rules]** from **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Marketing]** > **[!UICONTROL Promotion]** and add any condition which matches while placing an order (Example: subtotal greater than *5$*)

    * Apply any discount.
    * Select **[!UICONTROL Auto Coupon]**.
    * It will generate a few Coupon Codes from **Manage Coupon Codes**.
    * Reindex and clean the cache.

1. Create a **[!UICONTROL customer account]** and log into the frontend.
1. Add one product with more than *2* quantities in the cart and apply one coupon.
1. Click on **[!UICONTROL Check Out with Multiple Addresses]**.
1. Select a separate address for each quantity, place the order, and complete the checkout process.
1. Observe the order total from the admin and see the discount applied.
1. Place another order with another coupon.
1. Run the `php81 bin/Magento queue:consumers: start sales.rule.update.coupon.usage &` command to update coupon code usage.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The correct count should be displayed in the **Time used** and **Used** columns with **Yes** value for **[!UICONTROL manage coupon]** in the **[!UICONTROL cart price rule]** in the admin.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The used coupon code count doesn't update in the **Time Used** column in the coupons grid, and the **Used** column shows the *No* value if you place an order with multiple shipping addresses.
