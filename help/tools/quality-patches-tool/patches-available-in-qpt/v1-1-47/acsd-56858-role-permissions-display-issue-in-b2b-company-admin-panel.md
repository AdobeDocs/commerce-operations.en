## Issue

The role permissions for a restricted company admin in the B2B environment are inaccurately displayed.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Begin by setting up a company, adding a company admin and company users.
1. Log in as the company admin at the storefront and create various roles for different users.
1. Assign these roles as needed, such as limiting access for some tasks while allowing full access for others.
1. Assign these roles with full access to a user other than the company admin.
1. Log in to a non-company admin user, for e.g. a company_manager.
1. Navigate to **[!UICONTROL Roles and permission]** and edit the role.
1. Notice that the permissions displayed do not match the permissions set in the company's database for that role ID.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The roles and permission appear correctly for the non-company admin user.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The roles do not appear correctly for the non-company admin user as per the database records in the permission table.
