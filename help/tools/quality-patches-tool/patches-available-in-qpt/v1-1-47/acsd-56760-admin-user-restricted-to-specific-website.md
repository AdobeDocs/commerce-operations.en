## Issue

The Admin user that is restricted to a specific website and is unable to sort or add new products inside a category in case the web store has it's own root category. 

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create *2* websites.
1. Create a **[!UICONTROL restricted admin user]** with access to only *1* website.
1. Login as the **[!UICONTROL restricted admin user]** and try to change the product positions in a category.

*Case 1*:

* *2* stores.
* *2* root categories, each website assigned to it's own category root.

*Case 2*:

* *2* stores.
* Only *1* root category is assigned to both websites.

<u>Expected results</u>:

* *Case 1*: The restricted admin should be able to sort products inside the available category.
* *Case 2*: The restricted admin can't sort products inside the available category, because this will affect the restricted store as well.

<u>Actual results</u>:

* *Case 1*: The restricted admin isn't able to sort products inside the available category.
* *Case 2*: The restricted admin can sort products inside the available category, affecting the restricted stores.
