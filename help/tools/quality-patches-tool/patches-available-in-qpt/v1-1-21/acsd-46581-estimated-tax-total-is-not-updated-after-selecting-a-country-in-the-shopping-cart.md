## Issue

Tax rate does not get updated after switching the country in the shopping cart.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. In the Adobe Commerce Admin, go to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Tax Zone and Rates]**. 
1. Create a new tax rate for **[!UICONTROL Country]** = _United States_, **[!UICONTROL State]** = _*_, **[!UICONTROL Rate]** = _8.25_.
1. Create a new tax rate for **[!UICONTROL Country]** = _India_, **[!UICONTROL State]** = _*_, **[!UICONTROL Rate]** = _10_.
1. Create a tax rule with both tax rates for US and India.
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL Sales]** > **[!UICONTROL Shipping Methods]** and enable more than one shipping method (_Flat Rate_ and _Free Shipping_ for example).
1. Create a simple product with the **[!UICONTROL Taxable Goods]** tax class.
1. Add product to the cart on the store front.
1. Open the shopping cart and check the tax amount.
1. The default tax settings for the United States are applied and the tax is calculated based on an 8.25% rate.
1. Switch the country to India.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The tax amount changed to 10% when switching the country to India.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The tax amount remains the same in the total section of the shopping cart.
