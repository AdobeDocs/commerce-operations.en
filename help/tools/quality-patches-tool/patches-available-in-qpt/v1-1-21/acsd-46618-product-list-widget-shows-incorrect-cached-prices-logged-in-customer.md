<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. In the Adobe Commerce Admin, select **[!UICONTROL Stores]**, then **[!UICONTROL Configuration]**, expand **[!UICONTROL Sales]**, and select **[!UICONTROL Tax]**. Update the tax settings to show prices including and excluding taxes. 
1. Set **[!UICONTROL Enable Cross Border Trade]** = _Yes_.
1. Create a tax rule that only applies to the US.
1. Add a widget to the home page including more than one product.
1. Create two customers with a US address and a non US address.

1. Log out and log in using the non-US customer.
