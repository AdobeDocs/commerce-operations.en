## Issue

GraphQL currency API request returns null values for a custom currency.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Configure custom currency in the Admin. Go to **System** > **Configuration** > **General** > **Currency Setup**.
1. Send a GraphQL request with the following payload:

<pre>
<code class="language-graphql">
{
    currency {
        base_currency_code
        base_currency_symbol
        default_display_currency_code
        default_display_currency_symbol
        available_currency_codes
        exchange_rates {
            currency_to
            rate
        }
    }
}
</code>
</pre>

<u>Expected results</u>:

The request returns currency values instead of null values.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The request returns multiple null values.
