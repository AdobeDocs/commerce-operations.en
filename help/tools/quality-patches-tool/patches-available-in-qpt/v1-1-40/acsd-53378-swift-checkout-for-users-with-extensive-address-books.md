## Issue

Adobe Commerce's performance becomes very slow if a customer has a large number of addresses.

If the configuration option *[!UICONTROL Enable search address]* under **[!UICONTROL Sales]** > **[!UICONTROL Checkout]** > **[!UICONTROL Checkout Options]** is activated, the complete customer address book will no longer undergo full processing. The number of customer addresses processed is determined by the setting *[!UICONTROL Customer Addresses Limit]* under  **[!UICONTROL Sales]** > **[!UICONTROL Checkout]** > **[!UICONTROL Checkout Options]**.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a simple product from Admin.
1. Create a customer with an extensive address book containing 1000 addresses.
1. Navigate to the frontend, and add the product to the cart.
1. Open the shopping cart page.

<u>Expected results</u>:

Customer address count has no impact on the response time.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The shopping cart page takes a lot of time to load.
