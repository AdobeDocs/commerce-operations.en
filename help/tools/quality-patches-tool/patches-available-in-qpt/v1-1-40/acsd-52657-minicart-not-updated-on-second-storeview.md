## Issue

Minicart is not updated on the secondary storeview that uses a subdomain.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a second storeview and configure a subdomain for the base URL.
1. Update the cookie domain to have the common domain.
1. On the main store, add a product to the cart.
1. Refresh the second storeview, then go to the shopping cart page.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The shopping cart and minicart are updated on the subdomain.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Minicart is not updated when the secondary store is refreshed, but the cart page shows the added product, and you are able to place an order in that session (`PHPSESSID` cookie is shared).
