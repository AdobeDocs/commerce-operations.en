## Issue

The GraphQL product filter query is not showing partial match results.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Install a clean instance with sample data.
1. Run the following GraphQL query.

```GraphQL
{
  products(
    filter: { name: { match: "Life" } }
    sort: { position: ASC }
    pageSize: 100
    currentPage: 1
  ) {
    total_count
    items {
      url_key
      sku
      name
      meta_title
    }
  }
}
```

<u>Expected results</u>:

It allows similar match results as in storefront advance search by adding the `match_type` ([!UICONTROL PARTIAL], [!UICONTROL FULL]) attribute to control the required results. [!UICONTROL FULL] matches complete words, and [!UICONTROL PARTIAL] matches partial words like life contained in lifelong.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The product filter query does not return results of partial matches for search keywords.
