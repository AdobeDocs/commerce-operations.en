## Issue

The cron scheduler retrieves all negotiable quotes without excluding those with the status *[!UICONTROL Ordered]*, causing an email or emails to be triggered.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:


1. On the *Admin* sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > *[!UICONTROL Settings]* > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL B2B Features]** and enable Company and B2B Quote. 
1. Set **[!UICONTROL Default Expiration Period]** to *1* in *Admin* > **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > *[!UICONTROL Settings]* > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL Sales]** > **[!UICONTROL Quotes]** > **[!UICONTROL General]**.
1. Create a company, activate it, and log in as the company admin.
1. Add a product to the cart.
1. Request a quote.
1. On the *Admin* sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Sales]** > **[!UICONTROL Quotes]**.
1. Select the created quote, and click **[!UICONTROL Send]** to send the quote back to the buyer.
1. Log in as the company admin on the storefront.
1. Select the quote and click **[!UICONTROL Proceed to checkout]** to complete the purchase.
1. Check that the status of the quote is **[!UICONTROL Ordered]** and no more actions are possible on the storefront.
1. Trigger the *negotiable_quote_send_emails* cron job.


<u>Expected results</u>: 

Since the quote has been ordered and no further actions can be taken, no emails about the quote expiration should be sent.

<u>Actual results</u>:

An email *Quote expires soon* is sent.
