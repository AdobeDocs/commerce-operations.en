## Issue

The quote items are not visible in the admin if they are only assigned to the custom stock.

Prerequisites:

**[!UICONTROL B2B]** and **[!UICONTROL Inventory]** modules must be installed.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Enable **[!UICONTROL Company]** and **[!UICONTROL B2B Quote]** under **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL General]** > **[!UICONTROL B2B Features]**.
1. Create a secondary **[!UICONTROL Inventory Source]** and assign it to a secondary **[!UICONTROL Inventory Stock]**.
1. Create a new product by assigning only the secondary (non-default) **[!UICONTROL Inventory Source]**.
1. Go to the storefront and create a new company account. Log in as the **[!UICONTROL Company Admin]**, and add the created product to the cart.
1. Navigate to the cart and *[!UICONTROL Request a Quote]*.
1. Go to the admin and view the requested quote at **[!UICONTROL Sales]** > **[!UICONTROL Quotes]**.

<u>Expected results</u>:

Items are visible in the new quote created with new products without re-saving the products.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The *[!UICONTROL Items Quoted]* section is empty. If you re-save the newly created product, the items will appear.
