<u>Actual results</u>:

The following error is shown in the log file:

```
Text fields are not optimised for operations that require per-document field data like aggregations and sorting, so these operations are disabled by default. Please use a keyword field instead. Alternatively, set fielddata=true on [updated_at] in order to load field data by uninverting the inverted index.
```
