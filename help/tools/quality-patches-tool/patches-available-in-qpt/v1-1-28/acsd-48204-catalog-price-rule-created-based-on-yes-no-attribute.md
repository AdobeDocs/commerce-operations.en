## Issue

The catalog price rule created based on *Yes/No* attribute doesn't consider the selected scope.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create two websites (Default and W2).
1. Create a product attribute of *Yes/No* type.
    * Set [!UICONTROL Default value] = [!UICONTROL No]
    * [!UICONTROL Scope] = [!UICONTROL Website]
    * [!UICONTROL Use for Promo Rule Conditions] = [!UICONTROL Yes]
1. Create a configurable product based on any attribute with two variations (V1 and V2).
    * Add the *Yes/No* attribute to the configurable variations attribute set
    * For one of the variations (V1), set the value to *[!UICONTROL Yes]* on the non-default website (W2)
1. Create a catalog rule:
    * Applied to both websites
    * Condition: *Yes/No* attribute value is *[!UICONTROL Yes]*
    * Discount = 50%
1. Open the configurable product on the non-default website (W2).
1. Check that the V1 variation has the 50% discount applied.
1. Open the V1 variation in the Adobe Commerce Admin.
    * Switch to the default website
    * Make no changes and save the product
1. Refresh the configurable product storefront page.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The V1 variation still has the 50% discount applied as no changes were made.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The discount disappears.
