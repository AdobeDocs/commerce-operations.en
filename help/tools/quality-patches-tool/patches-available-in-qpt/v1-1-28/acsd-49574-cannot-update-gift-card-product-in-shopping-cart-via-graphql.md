## Issue

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

    Example of GraphQL usage:

    ```GraphQL
    mutation ($cartId: String!, $cartItems: [CartItemUpdateInput!]!){
        updateCartItems(
            input: {
                cart_id: $cartId,
                cart_items: $cartItems
            }
        )   {
            cart {
                id
                items {
                    uid
                    quantity
                    product {
                        sku
                    }
                    ... on GiftCardCartItem {
                        sender_name
                        sender_email
                        recipient_name
                        recipient_email
                        message
                        amount {
                            value
                            currency
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

                        "value_string": "recipient_email"
                    },
                    {
                        "uid": "Z2lmdGNhcmQvZ2lmdGNhcmRfbWVzc2FnZQ==",
                        "value_string": "message"
                    },
                    {
                        "uid": "Z2lmdGNhcmQvY3VzdG9tX2dpZnRjYXJkX2Ftb3VudA==",

                    }
                ]
            }]
    }
    ```
