## Issue

The price of a bundled product with Dynamic Pricing enabled is incorrect due to only in-stock items being included.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Go to the Commerce Admin panel.
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL CATALOG]** > **[!UICONTROL Products]** > **[!UICONTROL Add Product]** > **[!UICONTROL Bundle Product]**.
1. Set **[UICONROL Dynamic Price]** to **[!UICONTROL Yes]**.
1. Bundle items:
   * Set **[!UICONTROL Ship bundle items]** to **[!UICONTROL Together]**
   * Select **[!UICONTROL Add Option]**
      * **[!UICONTROL Title]** = o1
      * **[!UICONTROL Input type]** = **[!UICONTROL Dropdown]**
     * Mark required checkbox
     * Add any simple product which is in stock; for example, Joust Duffle Bag SKU 24-MB01. Before adding the product, note down its price - $34
    * Default quantity: 1
   *  Select **[!UICONTROL Add Option]**
      * **[!UICONTROL Option Title]** = o2
      * **[!UICONTROL Input type]** = **[!UICONTROL Dropdown]**
      * Mark required checkbox
      * Add any simple product which is in stock, different from the product added in the step before; for example - Strive Shoulder Pack 24-MB04. Before adding the product, note down its price - $32
      * Default quantity: 1
1. Save product.
1. Go to the storefront and find the product created in the previous steps. Note down its price - $66
(66 = 32 + 34).
Currently, the price of the bundle product is equal to the sum of the prices of its options.
1. Go to the Commerce Admin panel. Go to **[!UICONTROL CATALOG]** > **[!UICONTROL Products]**.
1. Find one of the simple products assigned as an option to the bundle product earlier:
SKU 24-MB01 and a price of $34.
1. Change its quantity to 0.
1. Save the product.
1. Go to the storefront and find the bundle product created in the previous steps. Note down its price - $32. Previously it was priced at $66, which was the sum of $34 from SKU 24-MB01 and $32 from SKU 24-MB04. Now that product 24-MB01 is out of stock, the bundle price is listed as $32. It is the price of the other product, which is an in-stock option.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The price of bundle products with Dynamic Pricing enabled is calculated consistently, no matter if options are in stock or out of stock.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The price of the bundle product with Dynamic Pricing enabled is miscalculated. It takes into account only options that are in stock, resulting in a lower amount displayed than the actual one when one of the options is out of stock.
