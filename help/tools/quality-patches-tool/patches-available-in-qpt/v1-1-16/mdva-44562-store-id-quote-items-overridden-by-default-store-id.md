## Issue

The store id for quote items is overridden by the default store id for GraphQL requests.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a new store view.
1. Create a new simple product with different names per store view.
1. Create a new customer.
1. Obtain the customer authorization token.

    ```GraphQL
     POST /rest/all/V1/integration/customer/token
     {
       "username": "test@example.com",
       "password": "password"
      }
    ```

1. Create a new quote for the customer using the authorization token.

    ```GraphQL
    POST rest/default/V1/carts/mine
    ```

1. Add a product to the cart.

    ```GraphQL
    POST /rest/default/V1/carts/mine/items
    {
      "cartItem": {
        "sku": "simple1",
        "qty": 1,
        "quote_id": "1"
      }
    }
    ```

1. Get the cart content for the default store view.

    ```GraphQL
    GET rest/default/V1/carts/mine/
    ```

1. Get the cart content for the new store view.

    ```GraphQL
    GET rest/<store_view_2>/V1/carts/mine/
    ```

<u>Expected results</u>:

Response from the new store view shows the product name from the new store view.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Response from the new store view shows the product name setup under the default store view.
