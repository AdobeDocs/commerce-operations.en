## Issue

Checkout performance degraded when a large number of customer segments were configured.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create multiple customer segments with several conditions and configure them to match **ANY** condition.
1. Create a cart price rule with a coupon that matches the previously created customer segment and as an action applies a discount of 20%.
1. Add a product to the cart on the **Storefront**.
1. Go to checkout.
1. Perform actions that trigger checking a customer segment:
    1. Register as a customer
    1. Enter an address
    1. Update an address
    1. Enter a coupon code

<u>Expected results</u>:

Acceptable performance with a large number of customer segments and conditions in them.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Checkout is slow.
