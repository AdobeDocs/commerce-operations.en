## Issue

The [!UICONTROL Gift Registry] functionality in Adobe Commerce is impacted by two significant issues:

* When a customer places an order for items from their [!UICONTROL Gift Registry], the process fails due to an exception being triggered. 
* Additionally, the [!UICONTROL Gift Registry Updates] email sent to the registry owner incorrectly includes items from all gift registries, rather than restricting the updates to items in the specific registry being updated. 

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create two products: Product A and Product B.
1. Create two customers: Customer A and Customer B.
1. Log in as Customer A and create a new [!UICONTROL Gift Registry].
1. Navigate to Product Aâ€™s product page and add it to the [!UICONTROL Wishlist]. Open the [!UICONTROL Wishlist Page] and move Product A to the [!UICONTROL Gift Registry] using [!UICONTROL Add to Gift Registry].
1. Log in as Customer B, create a new [!UICONTROL Gift Registry], and add Product B to it.
1. As Customer B, share the [!UICONTROL Gift Registry] via email: **[!UICONTROL My Account] > [!UICONTROL Gift Registry] > [!UICONTROL Share]**.
1. Log out as Customer B.
1. Click on the link received in the email. Add Product B to the [!UICONTROL Cart] and place an order.

<u>Expected results</u>:

Customer B receives the email with updated items only from their gift registry.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Customer B receives the email with items from all gift registries.
