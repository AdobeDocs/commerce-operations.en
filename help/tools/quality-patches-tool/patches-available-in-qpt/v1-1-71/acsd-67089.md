## Issue

The `inventory/export-stock-salable-qty` API returns an incorrect `total_count` value when `page_size` is set.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a new source and stock in the Admin.
1. Assign the first 22 products to the newly created source and stock.
1. Send a GET request to:
`/rest/all/V1/inventory/export-stock-salable-qty/website/base?searchCriteria[page_size]=50`.
1. Observe that the `total_count` is correctly returned as *22*.
1. Change `page_size` to *5* and send a GET request to:
`/rest/all/V1/inventory/export-stock-salable-qty/website/base?searchCriteria[page_size]=5`.
1. Observe that the `total_count` is incorrectly returned as *5* instead of *22*.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The `inventory/export-stock-salable-qty` API returns the correct `total_count` of *22*, regardless of the `page_size` value specified in the request.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The `inventory/export-stock-salable-qty` API returns an incorrect `total_count` of *5* when `page_size` is set to *5*, instead of the actual total of *22*.
