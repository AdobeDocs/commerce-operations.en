## Issue

Sitemap generation has long processing times for products with image inclusion enabled.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Generate a catalog of ~6,000 products across two websites using the provided fixture.
1. Enable sitemap generation with image inclusion set to "ALL".
1. Measure sitemap generation time.
1. Repeat with image inclusion set to "NONE" and compare performance.
1. Confirm that products without images do not cause unnecessary delays regardless of image inclusion settings.

<u>Expected results</u>:

1. Sitemap generation completes without exponential slowdown.
1. Performance is consistent whether image inclusion is set to "ALL" or "NONE".
1. Products without images do not impact generation time.

<u>Actual results</u>:

1. Sitemap generation previously slowed down significantly when image inclusion was enabled.
1. The issue is resolved with the new batch-based generation logic.
