## Issue

Adding an item to the cart multiple times (parallel request) for the same SKU creates a duplicate line item for the same cart ID.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a simple product with SKU = simple1.
1. Create a customer.
1. Generate a customer token for making GraphQL request.

    <pre>
    <code class="language-graphql">
    mutation {
        generateCustomerToken(
            email: "customer email"
            password: "customer password"
        )
        {
            token
        }
    }
    </code>
    </pre>

1. Use the token mentioned in step 3 to create an empty cart for the customer.

    <pre>
    <code class="language-graphql">
    mutation{
     createEmptyCart
    }
    </code>
    </pre>

1. Create a script to make two `addSimpleProductsToCart` requests running in parallel. For example:

    <pre>
    <code class="language-#!/bin/bash">
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJraWQiOiIxIiwiYWxnIjoiSFMyNTYifQ.eyJ1aWQiOjEsInV0eXBpZCI6MywiaWF0IjoxNjIzOTUyNjcwLCJleHAiOjE2MjM5NTYyNzB9.-fh7ysqiQTAacdB3MVvaXzFE9AmKyfF8TsVmICLJoWI" -d '{"query" : "mutation { addSimpleProductsToCart( input: { cart_id: \"S8dCF7uan1POMy0qY0Hup7tEv1AhFGdY\" cart_items: [ { data: { quantity: 2 sku: \"simple1\" } } ] } ) { cart { items { id product { name sku } quantity } } } }"}' http://magento2.3.local/graphql &
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJraWQiOiIxIiwiYWxnIjoiSFMyNTYifQ.eyJ1aWQiOjEsInV0eXBpZCI6MywiaWF0IjoxNjIzOTUyNjcwLCJleHAiOjE2MjM5NTYyNzB9.-fh7ysqiQTAacdB3MVvaXzFE9AmKyfF8TsVmICLJoWI" -d '{"query" : "mutation { addSimpleProductsToCart( input: { cart_id: \"S8dCF7uan1POMy0qY0Hup7tEv1AhFGdY\" cart_items: [ { data: { quantity: 1 sku: \"simple1\" } } ] } ) { cart { items { id product { name sku } quantity } } } }"}' http://magento2.3.local/graphql
    </code>
    </pre>

1. Run the script.

<u>Expected results</u>:

Only one product line with a total quantity (three in this case) is created in the Shopping Cart.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Two separate lines for the same product are created in the Shopping Cart.
