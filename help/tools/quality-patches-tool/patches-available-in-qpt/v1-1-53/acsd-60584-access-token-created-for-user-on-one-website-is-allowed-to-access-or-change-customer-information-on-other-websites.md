## Issue

The API token created for the user on one website allows you to access customer information, create a cart, and add products to the cart on other website views.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Ensure **[!DNL Share Customer Accounts configuration]** is set to **[!UICONTROL Per Website]**.
1. Create additional *website*, *store*, and *storeview*.
1. Create two customers with the same email on the main *website* and the *website* from previous step.
1. Generate a customer token via [!DNL GraphQL] on the main website.
1. Using the generated token, send a customer **[!DNL GraphQL]** query with the second website in the header to retrieve customer information.
1. Observe the returned result.


<u>Expected results</u>:

Customer information from the main *website* is returned because the token form the main *website* is used in **[!DNL GraphQL]** query.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Customer information from the second website is returned.
