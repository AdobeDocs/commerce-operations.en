## Issue

Customer shopping cart gets cleared after the customer session has expired with [!UICONTROL Persistent Shopping Cart] enabled.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Enable [!UICONTROL Persistent Shopping Cart]. Go to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL Customers]** > **[!UICONTROL Persistent Shopping Cart]** = *Yes*.

    Log in with Persistence enabled (Note: It is not available on the popup authorization, but only on the direct [!UICONTROL Sign in] page).

1. Add a product to the cart.
1. Proceed to checkout and select a payment method.
1. Expire the session (delete `PHPSESSID`).
1. Refresh the page. Observe that the quote is immediately converted to a guest quote because a payment method is already selected, and the [!UICONTROL Persistent Cart] cookie is removed.
1. Expire the session (delete `PHPSESSID`).
1. Refresh the page. See that the cart is empty.
1. Sign in again.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The cart has the product when you sign in again.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The cart is empty when signing in again.
