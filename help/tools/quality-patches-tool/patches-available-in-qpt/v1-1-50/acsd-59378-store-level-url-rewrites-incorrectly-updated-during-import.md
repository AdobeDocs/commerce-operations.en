## Issue

Store-level [!DNL URL] rewrites are incorrectly updated during import.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a product with `url_key = key_default` on the **All Store Views** scope.
1. Set `url_key = key_store` in the **Default Store View** scope.
1. Export the product.
1. Import a [!DNL CSV] file for this product with the following data in it:
    * `store_view_code` column is set to *empty* so that it applies for the **All Store Views** scope.
    * `url_key` is set to the default key *`key_default`*.

<u>Expected Results</u>:

[!DNL URL] rewrites are only regenerated for store views where there's no overridden `url_key` (where the default `url_key` applies).

<u>Actual Results</u>:

`key_store` [!DNL URL] rewrites are deleted, but the [!DNL URL] rewrite on the **Default Store View** level for the product is still set to *`key_store`*.
