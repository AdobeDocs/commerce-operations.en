        * *Wholesale* = *$200* 
         * *Retailer* = *$30* 

1. Create two customer accounts.
1. Assign both customers to the **Wholesale** group.
1. Open two different browser sessions and log in with each customer.
1. Navigate to the **[!UICONTROL 24-MB01]** product page for each customer and verify that the price displayed is *$200*.
1. Change the customer group for one of the customers to **Retail**.
1. Clear the cache using the command: `bin/magento cache:flush full_page`.
1. Refresh the product page for each customer.

<u>Expected results</u>:
