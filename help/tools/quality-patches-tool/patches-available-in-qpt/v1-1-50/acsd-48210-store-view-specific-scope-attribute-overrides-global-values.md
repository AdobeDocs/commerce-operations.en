## Issue

When updating a *[!UICONTROL Website Scope]* attribute within a specific store view overrides the attribute values in the global scope.

Importing product prices with multiple rows sharing the same `SKU` and `store_view_code` caused incorrect updates to the prices in the *[!UICONTROL All Store View]* and *[!UICONTROL Default Store]* scopes. Modifying the website scope attribute in a specific store view no longer overrides the attribute's value in the global scope.
<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Configure the *[!UICONTROL Catalog Price Scope]* to *[!UICONTROL Website]*.
1. Create a simple product named as *SP01* and set the price to *$84.50*.
1. Import the product using the following CSV provided below:
    
    ```
    sku,store_view_code,price
    SP01,default,99.99
    SP01,default,86.59
    ```
    
1. Check the product price in the *[!UICONTROL All Store View]* and *[!UICONTROL Default Store]* scopes.

<u>Expected results</u>:

* The first non-empty value is used for the *[!UICONTROL Default Store]* scope.
* The *[!UICONTROL All Store View]* scope remains unchanged.

<u>Actual results</u>:

* The *[!UICONTROL All Store View]* scope price changes to *$86.59*.
* The *[!UICONTROL Default Store]* scope price changes to *$86.59*.
