## Issue

`PHPSESSID` regenerates on [!DNL POST] requests for a logged-in customer with the L2 Redis cache enabled.

<u>Prerequisites</u>

Environment must be configured with Redis having at least 3 nodes.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a simple product.
1. Create a customer and log in to the Storefront.
1. Check the value of `PHPSESSID`.
1. Send a few [!DNL POST] requests (For e.g., adding product to cart), and see that `PHPSESSID` remains the same).
1. Log in to the **[!UICONTROL Admin]** panel and change the middle name of the customer. 
1. When the middle name is saved, change it and save it again a few times.
1. On the storefront, send a [!DNL POST] request. `PHPSESSID` should have been updated.
1. On the storefront, send another [!DNL POST] request and check `PHPSESSID`.
1. Repeat the previous step a few times.

<u>Expected results</u>

`PHPSESSID` is regenerated only once after changing customer data.

<u>Actual results</u>:

`PHPSESSID` is regenerated every time the [!DNL POST] requests are sent.
