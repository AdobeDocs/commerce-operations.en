## Issue

An exception occurs when loading product prices with both lower and upper bounds set to *$0*.

The issue is occurring because the algorithm does not account for NULL values when loading the query with price ranges. To fix this, we can check if both the lower and upper ranges are NULL, and if they are, assign a value of *0* for both limits. This should prevent any errors from being thrown.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create *13* simple products.
1. Assign all *13* products to a category.
1. Set the price of one product to *$1322.94*.
1. Set the price of all other products to *$0*.
1. Configure [!DNL OpenSearch] as a search engine.
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** > **[!UICONTROL Storefront]** and set the **[!UICONTROL PLP]** count to *16*.
1. Set **[!UICONTROL Price Navigation Step Calculation]** to *Automatic (equalize product counts)*.
1. Run full reindex.
1. Open the *[!UICONTROL Category]* page.
   
<u>Expected results</u>:

The *[!UICONTROL Category]* page displays all the products.

<u>Actual results</u>:

An error occurs:

```JSON
report.CRITICAL: OpenSearch\Common\Exceptions\BadRequest400Exception: {"error":{"root_cause":[{"type":"x_content_parse_exception","reason":"[1:193] [bool] failed to parse field [must]"}],"type":"x_content_parse_exception","reason":"[1:193] [bool] failed to parse field [filter]","caused_by":{"type":"x_content_parse_exception","reason":"[1:193] [bool] failed to parse field [must]","caused_by":{"type":"illegal_argument_exception","reason":"field name is null or empty"}}},"status":400} in /vendor/opensearch-project/opensearch-php/src/OpenSearch/Connections/Connection.php:664
