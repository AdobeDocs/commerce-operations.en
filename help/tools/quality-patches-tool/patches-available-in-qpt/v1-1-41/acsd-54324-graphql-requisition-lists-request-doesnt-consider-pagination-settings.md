## Issue

The GraphQL `requisition_lists` request does not consider pagination settings and returns all results.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Log in to admin, and navigate to **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Store]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL General]** > **[!UICONTROL B2B Features]**.

    * Set *[!UICONTROL Enable Requisition List]* to *Yes*.

1. Log in to the frontend, and go to **[!UICONTROL My Requisition Lists]** from the top menu or from **[!UICONTROL My Account]**, and create multiple requisitions (example: 7).
1. After generating a customer token, run the below GraphQL `requisition_lists` query for the customer.

    * Ensure that the page size is less than the total number of requisition lists created by you (example: 4)

    ```
    {
    customer {
    requisition_lists(pageSize: 4, currentPage: 1) {
    items

    { uid name description updated_at items_count }
    total_count
    }
    }
    }
    ```

1. Observe that the value of the `total_count` field shows 7, when it should show 4. 

    The number of items also shows 7 when it should be the same as the *page size*. 

<u>Expected results</u>:

* The number listed as *page size* is returned under `total_count` and not the total number of records. 
* The number of items is the same as the *page size*.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The total number of records is returned under `total_count`, even if *page size* is mentioned.
