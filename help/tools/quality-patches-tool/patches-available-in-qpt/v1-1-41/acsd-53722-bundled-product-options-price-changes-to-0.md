## Issue

The price of bundled product options changes to $0 when scheduled updates for different scopes become active.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create two websites, A and B.
1. Set configuration under **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** > **[!UICONTROL Price]** > **[!UICONTROL Catalog Price Scope]** = **[!UICONTROL Website]**.
1. Create a bundled product with a fixed price on websites A and B:

    * Bundled product price = Fixed = *0*

1. Add one simple product as a drop-down option for the bundle. Set the following prices:

    * Simple product's all store views price inside bundled option = *120*
    * Simple product's website A price inside bundled option = *130*
    * Simple product's website B price inside bundled option = *140*

1. Schedule an update to disable the bundled product on website A.

<u>Expected results</u>:

Scheduled update for website A does not impact website B's price.

<u>Actual results</u>:

After the scheduled update, the price of the bundled product option on website B is changed to **$0**.
