## Issue

The order total is incorrect when placing a purchase order with disabled or out-of-stock products.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Install *[!UICONTROL B2B]* and *[!UICONTROL Inventory]*.
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Store]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL B2B]** and set **[!UICONTROL Company]** = *Yes* and **[!UICONTROL Purchase Order]** = *Yes*.
1. Clear configuration cache.
1. Create a new company, activate it, and enable *[!UICONTROL Purchase order]* for the company.
1. Create a new user for the company.
1. Create an *Approval rule* to approve all orders of more than *1 USD* by the company administrator.
1. Create an additional source.
1. Log in as the new company user.
1. Add two products to the cart and place a purchase order.
1. Disable the second product.
1. Log in as the company admin.
1. Open the purchase order and see that the purchase order contains both products and the total is for both products.
1. Approve the purchase order.
1. Place the order.
1. Open the order details.

<u>Expected results</u>:

* Cannot place the order even if one product in the order is *disabled* or *out of stock*.
* *[!UICONTROL Place Order]* button is hidden.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The placed order contains only the first active product, but the order total is calculated for both products.
