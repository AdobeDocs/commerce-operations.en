## Issue

The reward points balance history is miscalculated after the expiration date of the reward points.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a customer on the storefront.
1. Add reward points for the customer with different expiration dates.
1. Check the `magento_reward_history` table and set the expiration date for the latest record of reward points to a past date:

    ```
    UPDATE magento_reward_history SET expired_at_static = '2023-08-24 10:47:38' WHERE history_id = 3;
    ```

1. Check the reward history grid in **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Customers]** > **[!UICONTROL All Customers]** > **[!UICONTROL Edit customer]** > **[!UICONTROL Reward points]** > **[!UICONTROL Reward Points History]** and **[!UICONTROL Reward Points Balance]**.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The reward points balance only shows the unexpired points.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The reward points balance reflects the amount that includes the expired points.
