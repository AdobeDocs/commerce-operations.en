## Issue

When frequently switching between bookmark views, the saved filters in admin grids do not function as intended. 

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Access the [!DNL Sales Order] grid in the Admin.
1. Create two to three filters.
1. Verify the filter settings by switching views to ensure they are saved accurately.
1. Go to Filter1 or Filter2.
1. Refresh the page to update the displayed data.
1. Switch to a different view and notice that the filters remain unchanged.
1. Notice that the default view is now displaying filtered results, even though no specific filter was set for it.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The filters do not get interchanged and retain their original state.

<u>Actual results</u>:

When modifying a view, the filters get mixed up, and the correct view is not saved.
