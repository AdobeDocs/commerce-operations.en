# ACSD-53583: Improve partial reindex performance for Category Products and Product Categories indexers

The ACSD-53583 patch improves the partial reindex performance of *Category Products* and *Product Categories* indexers. This patch is available when the [!DNL Quality Patches Tool (QPT)] 1.1.39 is installed. The patch ID is ACSD-53583. Please note that the issue is scheduled to be fixed in Adobe Commerce 2.4.7.

## Affected products and versions

**The patch is created for Adobe Commerce version:**

* Adobe Commerce (all deployment methods) 2.4.5-p3

**Compatible with Adobe Commerce versions:**

* Adobe Commerce (all deployment methods) 2.4.4 - 2.4.6-p3
* Not compatible with [!DNL Live Search] module. In order to apply this patch to [!DNL Live Search] installation, please request an additional ACSD-55719 patch.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The patch might become applicable to other versions with new [!DNL Quality Patches Tool] releases.

## Issue

Partial reindex takes more time than full reindex.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Turn all indexers to *Update by Schedule*.
1. Generate data with the [!DNL Performance Toolkit] (medium profile).
1. Make changes to all products and categories so that they are in the index backlog and all indices are idle.
1. Perform partial reindex for *Category Products* and *Product Categories* indexers.

<u>Expected results</u>:

Partial reindex is called once per product and takes almost the same time as full reindex, because all products and categories were changed.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Partial reindex is called many times per product and takes more time than full reindex.
