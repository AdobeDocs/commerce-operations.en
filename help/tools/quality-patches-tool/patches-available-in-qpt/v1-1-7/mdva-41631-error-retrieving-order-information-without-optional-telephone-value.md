## Issue

Users get an error retrieving order information without optional "telephone" value through GraphQL.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Go to **Store** > **Configuration** > **Customers** > **Customer Configuration** > **Name and Address Options** > **Show Telephone** and set the phone number as optional.
1. Place an order using GraphQL API as a logged-in customer.
    * Do not set the telephone number when setting the billing and shipping addresses. Follow the instructions given in [GraphQL Checkout Tutorial](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/graphql/tutorials/checkout/checkout-customer.html) in our developer documentation.
1. Retrieve the order using the GraphQL [customerOrders query](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/graphql/queries/customer-orders.html).

<pre>
<code class="language-graphql">
{
  customer {
    firstname
    lastname
    suffix
    email

    orders(filter:{number:{eq:"000000001"}}){
        items{
          billing_address {
firstname
lastname
street
city
region
region_id
postcode
telephone
country_code
}
shipping_address {
firstname
lastname
street
city
region
region_id
postcode
telephone
country_code
}
        }
    }
  }
}
</code>
</pre>

<u>Actual results</u>:
