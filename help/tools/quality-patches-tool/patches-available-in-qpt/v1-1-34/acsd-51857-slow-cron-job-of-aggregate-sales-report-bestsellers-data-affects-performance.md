## Issue

Cron job performance of `aggregate_sales_report_bestsellers_data` is slow on `sales_order` and `sales_order_item` database tables.

To resolve this, the main data query that grabs data for the report has been re-written to a more efficient form. It now uses a sub-query to determine data subset. 

In order for the sub-query to function as fast as possible, a new index was added for the `sales_order` database table: `SALES_ORDER_STORE_STATE_CREATED` based on `store_id`, `state`, and `created_at` columns.

<u>Prerequisites</u>

Ensure a large number of orders daily.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>

1. Execute the `aggregate_sales_report_bestsellers_data` cron job.
1. Check the data to be displayed in the Admin dashboard, under the **[!UICONTROL Bestsellers]** tab.

<u>Expected results</u>:

*[!UICONTROL Quantity per source]* under the **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** tab shouldn't be empty.

<u>Actual results</u>:

*[!UICONTROL Quantity per source]* under the **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** tab is empty.
