## Issue

An error is returned when the `structure_id` is requested in a `CompanyTeam` GraphQL request.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL General]** > **[!UICONTROL B2B Features]**, and set *[!UICONTROL Enable Company]* to *Yes*.
1. Create a company along with a company admin user.
1. Create a new customer (*customer1*), and assign the company (created above) to this customer.
1. On the frontend, log in as the company admin user.
1. Create a company team, and assign *customer1* to the team using drag and drop.
1. Run the following company GraphQl query, which includes `CompanyTeam` with `structure_id`:

    ```GraphQL
    query{
        company {
            id
            name
            structure {
                items {
                id
                parent_id
                entity {
                    __typename
                    ... on Customer {
                        firstname
                        lastname
                        email
                        structure_id
                    }
                    ... on CompanyTeam {
                        id
                        name
                        structure_id
                    }
                }
        }
    }
    }
    }
    ```

1. Check the GraphQL response.

<u>Expected results</u>:

No errors are returned, and all requested data are present in the GraphQL response.

<u>Actual results</u>:

* Response contains an *Internal server error*.
* `var/log/exception.log` contains:

    ```
    report.ERROR: Cannot return null for non-nullable field "CompanyTeam.structure_id"
    ```
