```
#!/bin/bash
baseUrl=" "
orderId=3
token=$(curl --location --request POST "${baseUrl}rest/V1/integration/admin/token" \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 -d '{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "password"
}')
echo ${token//\"/}
curl --location --request POST "${baseUrl}/rest/V1/orders/${orderId}/cancel" \
 -H "Authorization:Bearer ${token//\"/}" \
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 &
sleep 0.1;
curl --location --request POST "${baseUrl}/rest/V1/orders/${orderId}/cancel" \
 -H "Authorization:Bearer ${token//\"/}" \
