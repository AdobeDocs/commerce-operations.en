## Issue

GraphQL company roles don't display pagination correctly.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Enable B2B company.
1. On the storefront, create a new company.
1. Create at least two new roles for this company, so there are a total of three roles, as one role is the default.
1. Send GraphQL request to get roles specifying [!UICONTROL pageSize]: 2.

    ```GraphQL
    query {
        company {
            roles(pageSize: 2, currentPage: 1) {
                items {
                    name
                }
                total_count
                page_info {
                    total_pages
                    current_page
                }
            }
        }
    } 
    ```
    
1. Check the GraphQL response.

<u>Expected results</u>:

`total_count: 3` and `total_pages: 2` are returned in the GraphQL response.

<u>Actual results</u>:

`total_count: 2` and `total_pages: 1` are returned in the GraphQL response.
