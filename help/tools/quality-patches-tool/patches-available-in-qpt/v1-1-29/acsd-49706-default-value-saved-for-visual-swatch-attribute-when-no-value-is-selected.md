1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add New Attribute]**.
1. Fill in the fields.
    
    * For example, choose input type *[!UICONTROL Visual Swatch]*, and add multiple options (such as *Red*, *Green*). Make sure to choose one of these options as default.
    * Click **[!UICONTROL Save Attribute]**. 

1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Attributes]** > **[!UICONTROL Attribute Set]**.
1. Edit the *[!UICONTROL Default]* attribute set.
1. Move *[!UICONTROL New Attribute]* from the column *[!UICONTROL Unassigned Attributes]* to the *[!UICONTROL Product Details]* folder in the middle column.

    * Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

1. Create a new product using the *[!UICONTROL Default]* attribute set.

    * Leave the *[!UICONTROL New Attribute]* empty and save it.
