1. Create new stock using the main website with the source created above.
1. Create a product assigning the same source.
1. Set stock qty = 1.
1. Check out the product created in step 4 using the *[!UICONTROL In-Store Delivery]* method from the storefront.
1. Create an invoice for the order.
1. Set the qty of the product to *0* and make it out of stock.

    "orderIds": [
        1
    ]
}
```
