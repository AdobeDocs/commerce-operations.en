## Issue

Invoices, shipments, and credit memos are not moved back from the archive when the orderId is different.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Enable orders, invoices, shipments, and credit memos archiving.
1. Create and complete an order, including shipping, invoice, and credit memo.
1. Ensure the shipping, invoice, and credit memo IDs are not the same as the order number.
1. Move the order to archive.
1. Restore the archived order to order management.
1. Check invoice, shipping, and credit memo details under the respective [!UICONTROL Invoice], [!UICONTROL Shipping], and [!UICONTROL Credit Memo] grid pages.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The original related records are restored when the order is moved from the archive list to order management.

<u>Actual results</u>:

* No records for shipping, invoice, and credit memos if all the IDs are different.
* If the order and related records have the same ID, then the records are returned.
