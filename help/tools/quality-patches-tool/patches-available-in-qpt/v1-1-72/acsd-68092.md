## Issue

Bundle product options are lost after multiple saves due to improper synchronization between scheduled updates and base product data.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a simple product.
1. Create a bundle product with 1 drop-down option and associate the simple product.
1. Create a content staging update with a start date and an end date in the future (For example: to change the name).
1. Exit the popup after creating the content staging update to return to editing the product data before the update starts.
1. Delete the existing option and [!UICONTROL Save].
1. Recreate the option (drop-down with the simple product associated) and [!UICONTROL Save].
1. [!UICONTROL Save] again.
1. Observe that the simple product isn't associated anymore.
1. [!UICONTROL Save] again.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The existing or newly created options and their associated products shouldn't be removed when saving multiple-times a bundle product with a planned scheduled update.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Options and their associated products are removed when saving multiple-times a bundle product with a planned scheduled update.
