## Issue

Issue where customerCart GraphQL query returns product attribute values that do not reflect the store header, causing inconsistent localization.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a new store view under an existing store.
1. Create a product.
1. Update the product name to a different value under the default store view.
1. Create a customer account.
1. Add the product to the cart as a logged-in user using GraphQL.
1. Fetch the cart data for both store views by changing the Store header.

<u>Expected results</u>:

1. GraphQL returns product data (e.g., name, description) specific to the store view set in the request header.

<u>Actual results</u>:
