## Issue

Creating scheduled updates in environments with a high number of nested categories results in duplicate entries, leading to errors and failure to save the category.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Install a clean instance.
1. Modify the performance fixtures file (small.xml) to include:
    1. **[!UICONTROL Categories]**: *2500*
    1. **[!UICONTROL Products]**: *250,000*
1. Generate the data using the command:

    ```
    bin/magento setup:performance:generate-fixtures var/performance-toolkit/profiles/ce/small.xml
    ```

1. After creating products and categories, ensure all categories are set as anchors by running the following query:

    ```
    UPDATE catalog_category_entity_int set value = 1 where attribute_id = (select attribute_id from eav_attribute where attribute_code = 'is_anchor');Â 
    ```

1. Reindex the data.
1. Log in to the Admin panel and navigate to **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** > **[!UICONTROL Categories]**.
1. Move **Category 2** under **Category 1**to create a more nested structure.
1. Go to a deeply nested category, for example, **Category 2.1.1**.
1. Create a **[!UICONTROL Scheduled Update]**.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The category is saved successfully.

<u>Actual results</u>:

An error occurs, and the category fails to save. `var/log/exception.log` contains error an similar to:

```
Exception #0 (Magento\Framework\DB\Adapter\DuplicateException): SQLSTATE[23000]: Integrity constraint violation: 1062 Duplicate entry '229-255' for key 'temp_category_descendants_619aaaaaaaaaa.PRIMARY', query was: INSERT INTO `temp_category_descendants_619aaaaaaaaaa` (`category_id`, `descendant_id`) SELECT `ce`.`entity_id` AS `category_id`, `ce2`.`entity_id` AS `descendant_id` FROM `catalog_category_entity` AS `ce`
 INNER JOIN `catalog_category_entity` AS `ce2` ON ce2.path LIKE CONCAT(ce.path, '/%') OR ce2.entity_id = ce.entity_id AND (ce2.created_in <= '1750287600' AND ce2.updated_in > '1750287600') WHERE ((ce.entity_id IN (4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 24, 25, 27, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 48, 51, 54, 56, 57, 59, 60, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67 .......
