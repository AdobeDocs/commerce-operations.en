## Issue

Issue where creating scheduled updates results in duplicate entries in environments with a high number of nested categories.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Install clean instance
1. Generate data - use performance fixtures file (small.xml) with modifications:
    1. Categories: 2500
    1. Products: 250,000
1. Run:

```
bin/magento setup:performance:generate-fixtures var/performance-toolkit/profiles/ce/small.xml
```

 

1. After creating products and categories, ensure all of them are anchors, run query:

```
UPDATE catalog_category_entity_int set value = 1 where attribute_id = (select attribute_id from eav_attribute where attribute_code = 'is_anchor'); 
```

1. Reindex.
1. Log in to the backend and open the Categories page.
1. Move **Category 2** to **Category 1**, so the tree is more nested.
1. Go to the most nested category, for example, {**}Category 2.1.1{**}.
1. Create a **Scheduled Update**.
1. Save category.

<u>Expected results</u>:

Category is saved.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Category is not saved and an error occur.
var/log/exception.log contains error like:

```
Exception #0 (Magento\Framework\DB\Adapter\DuplicateException): SQLSTATE[23000]: Integrity constraint violation: 1062 Duplicate entry '229-255' for key 'temp_category_descendants_619aaaaaaaaaa.PRIMARY', query was: INSERT INTO `temp_category_descendants_619aaaaaaaaaa` (`category_id`, `descendant_id`) SELECT `ce`.`entity_id` AS `category_id`, `ce2`.`entity_id` AS `descendant_id` FROM `catalog_category_entity` AS `ce`
