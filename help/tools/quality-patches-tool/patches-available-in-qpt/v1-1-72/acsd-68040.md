## Issue

Issue where the frontend search page experiences performance degradation on MariaDB 10.6 and 11.4 with many historical search requests.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Install clean instance with MariaDB 10.6 (for testing purposes)
2. Generate 2M entries in search_query table
3. Execute SQL query: 

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT `main_table`.`query_text` FROM `search_query` AS `main_table` WHERE (main_table.store_id IN (1)) AND (main_table.num_results > 0) ORDER BY `main_table`.`popularity` desc LIMIT 100) AS `result` WHERE (result.query_text = 'seed_q_0000009'); 
```

4. Notice that query takes up to ~13 seconds
5. Upgrade Maria DB to 11.4
6. Execute SQL query:

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT `main_table`.`query_text` FROM `search_query` AS `main_table` WHERE (main_table.store_id IN (1)) AND (main_table.num_results > 0) ORDER BY `main_table`.`popularity` desc LIMIT 100) AS `result` WHERE (result.query_text = 'seed_q_0000009');  
```

7. Notice that query takes around 0.4-0.5 seconds

<u>Expected results</u>:

The table or query should be optimized so execution time is minimized regardless of the MariaDB version.

<u>Actual results</u>:

MariaDB 10.6 → 13–15 seconds
MariaDB 11.4 → 0.4–0.5 seconds
