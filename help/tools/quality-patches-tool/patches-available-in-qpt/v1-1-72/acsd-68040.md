## Issue

The frontend search page slows significantly on [!DNL MariaDB] 10.6 when processing a high volume of historical search requests. A query on the `search_query` table takes up to 13 seconds on [!DNL MariaDB] 10.6, compared to under 0.5 seconds on [!DNL MariaDB] 11.4.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Install a clean instance with [!DNL MariaDB] 10.6 for testing purposes.
1. Populate the `search_query` table with 2 million entries.
1. Execute the following SQL query:

    ```
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (
        SELECT `main_table`.`query_text`
        FROM `search_query` AS `main_table`
        WHERE (main_table.store_id IN (1))
          AND (main_table.num_results > 0)
        ORDER BY `main_table`.`popularity` DESC
        LIMIT 100
    ) AS `result`
    WHERE (result.query_text = 'seed_q_0000009');
    ```

1. Observe that the query takes approximately 13 seconds to complete.
1. Upgrade the database to [!DNL MariaDB] 11.4.
1. Re-execute the same SQL query:

    ```
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (
        SELECT `main_table`.`query_text`
        FROM `search_query` AS `main_table`
        WHERE (main_table.store_id IN (1))
          AND (main_table.num_results > 0)
        ORDER BY `main_table`.`popularity` DESC
        LIMIT 100
    ) AS `result`
    WHERE (result.query_text = 'seed_q_0000009');
    ```

1. Observe that the query now completes in approximately 0.4–0.5 seconds.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The query or table structure should be optimized to ensure minimal execution time, regardless of the MariaDB version.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The query takes approximately 13–15 seconds on MariaDB 10.6 and 0.4–0.5 seconds on MariaDB 11.4.
