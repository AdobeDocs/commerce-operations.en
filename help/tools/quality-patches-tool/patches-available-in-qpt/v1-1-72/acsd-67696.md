## Issue

`media_gallery` entries not returning in the Cart GraphQL product node after a cache flush

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Add images to a product ex. SKU `product_dynamic_23` (no need to select any options like Base Image, Small Image, or Thumbnail Image).
1. Run the Product GraphQL to see product images inside the `media_gallery` entry of the product response.

```
{
  products(filter: { sku: { eq: "product_dynamic_23" } }) {
    items {
      name
      sku
      url_key
      stock_status
			media_gallery {
          url
          label
			}
      price_range {
        minimum_price {
          regular_price {
            value
            currency
          }
        }
      }
    }
    total_count
    page_info {
      page_size
    }
  }
}
```

1. Add product to cart and check getCart query. `media_gallery` is inside the product node in the cart items node.
1. Flush the cache from the admin. `media_gallery` is empty inside the product node in the getCart query.
1. Run the Product GraphQL query, then run the getCart query to see the `media_gallery` entries inside the getCart response.

<u>Expected results</u>:

getCart GraphQL must return `media_gallery` values even after cache is flushed.

<u>Actual results</u>:

`media_gallery` is empty after cache flush, causing inconsistency.
