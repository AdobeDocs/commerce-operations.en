## Issue

Issue where the "My Account" page doesn't display recent orders from other store views within the same store.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Install Adobe Commerce
2. Create a new Store View: code - {**}**second**{**}.
3. Create a simple product and reindex.
4. Create a customer account and place an order in the default Store View: code - {**}**default**{**}.
5. Go to the My Orders page and check the order is visible in both Store Views, for example:
1. Default: [https://localhost/pub/default/sales/order/history/]
1. Second: [https://localhost/pub/second/sales/order/history/]Â 

6. Go to the My Account page in both Store Views:
1. Default: [https://localhost/pub/default/customer/account/]
1. Second: [https://localhost/pub/second/customer/account/]

<u>Expected results</u>:

To see orders in both Store Views like on the Orders page. It's the same Store, only a different Store View.

<u>Actual results</u>:
