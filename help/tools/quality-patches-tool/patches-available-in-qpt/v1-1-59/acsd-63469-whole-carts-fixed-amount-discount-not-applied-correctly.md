## Issue

When multiple **[!UICONTROL Fixed amount discount for whole cart]** rules are applied simultaneously, and the products have discounted or special prices, the discount value is calculated incorrectly. 

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create two products with prices of $850 and $85, and set their special prices to $765 and $68, respectively.
1. Create two **[!UICONTROL Cart Price Rules]** as follows:
    * Rule 1
        * **[!UICONTROL Conditions]** -> *Qty >= 2, $850 product*
        * **[!UICONTROL Actions]** -> **[!UICONTROL Fixed amount discount for whole cart]** = $153
    * Rule 2
        * **[!UICONTROL Conditions]** -> *Qty >= 2, $85 product*
        * **[!UICONTROL Actions]** -> **[!UICONTROL Fixed amount discount for whole cart]** = $14
1. Add two products to the cart, each with a quantity of 2.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The discount applied in the cart is $167.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The discount applied in the cart is $41.
