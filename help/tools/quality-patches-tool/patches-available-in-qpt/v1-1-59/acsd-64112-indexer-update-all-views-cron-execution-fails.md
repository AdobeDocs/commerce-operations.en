## Issue

The `indexer_update_all_views` cron execution fails when `MAGE_INDEXER_THREADS_COUNT` is set to a value greater than 2, specifically affecting the [!UICONTROL Customer Segments] indexer with B2B enabled.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Install a clean instance with B2B.
1. Enable **[!UICONTROL B2B Company]** and **[!UICONTROL Shared Catalog]**.
1. Create a category.
1. Create a few products and assign them to the category.
1. Execute a full reindex.
1. Set the following indexers to **[!UICONTROL Update on Schedule]**:

    ```
    bin/magento indexer:set-mode schedule catalogpermissions_category catalogpermissions_product
    ```

1. Go to the backend and load the newly created category. 
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Category Permissions]** and create a **[!UICONTROL New Permission]** for an existing customer group.
1. Ensure the `catalogpermissions_category` indexer has a backlog. Execute the following command to verify this:

    ```
    bin/magento indexer:status
    ```

1. Set the following indexer thread count in `env.php`:

    ```php
    'MAGE_INDEXER_THREADS_COUNT' => 8
    ```

1. Run the cron job:

    ```
    bin/magento cron:run
    ```

<u>Expected results</u>:

The cron job should execute without any issues.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The `indexer_update_all_views` cron job encounters the following error:

```
report.CRITICAL: PDOException: There is no active transaction in /home/vendor/magento/zend-db/library/Zend/Db/Adapter/Pdo/Abstract.php:326
```
