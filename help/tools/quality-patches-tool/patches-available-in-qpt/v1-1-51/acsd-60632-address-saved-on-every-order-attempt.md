## Issue

Each time an order placement is attempted, a new address entry is saved in the system, regardless of whether the order is successfully created.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Enable **[!UICONTROL PayPal PayFlow Link]** payment method:
    * On a local machine, it cannot receive API calls from PayPal PayFlow Link without a real IP.
1. Create a simple product.
1. Create a registered customer without address.
1. Add the product to cart.
1. Proceed to Checkout.
1. Fill in the address. Ensure that the first address is created at this step.
1. On the **[!UICONTROL Review and Payments]** page select *Credit Card (Payflow Link)* radio button.
1. Click the *Continue* button:
    * The checkout page returns to the **[!UICONTROL Review and Payments]** step with the pre-populated address and the expected error message.
1. Select *[!UICONTROL Credit Card (Payflow Link)]* radio button again.
1. Click on the *Continue* button again.

<u>Expected results</u>:

A new address is not created on the second order placement attempt.

<u>Actual results</u>:

A new address is created after every order placement attempt.
