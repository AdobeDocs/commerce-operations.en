            quantity: 1
            sku: "test"
          }
        ]
      ) {
        cart {
           itemsV2 {
           items {
            product {
             name
             sku
            }
            quantity
        }
        total_count
        page_info {
          page_size
          current_page
          total_pages

      }
    }

    email
    itemsV2(pageSize: 2, currentPage: 3) {
        total_count
        page_info {
           page_size
           current_page
           total_pages
        }
      items {
        id
        product {
