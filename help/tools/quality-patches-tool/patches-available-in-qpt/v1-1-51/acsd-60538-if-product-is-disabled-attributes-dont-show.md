## Issue

If a product is disabled in *[!UICONTROL All Store Views]* and enabled only in specific store view scopes, the product attributes don't show correctly in the GraphQL response, leading to the product not being displayed properly.

<u>Prerequisites</u>:

Inventory module is installed.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a configurable product with the *color* attribute, and three child products (*blue*, *black*, *brown*).
1. Disable two associated child products (*blue* and *black*) on the *[!UICONTROL All Store Views]* scope.
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Store View]** scope.
1. Enable child products (*blue* and *black*) on *[!UICONTROL Store View]* scope. 
1. Run the below GraphQL request:

    ```GraphQL
    {
      products(filter: { sku: { eq: "SKU" } }) {
        items {
            ... on ConfigurableProduct {
              configurable_options {
                attribute_id,
                attribute_code,
             values {
              value_index
              label
            }
        }
        variants {
          product {
            sku
          }
          attributes {
            label
            code
            value_index
           }
          }
         }
        }
       }
      }  
    ```

<u>Expected results</u>:

GraphQL response includes the attribute values for the child associated product that is disabled on *[!UICONTROL All Store Views]* and enabled on the store view scope.

<u>Actual results</u>:

GraphQL response has empty attribute values for the child associate product when the product is disabled on *[!UICONTROL All Store Views]* and enabled on the store view scope.
