## Issue

A GraphQL query returns an error when fetching a `quote_id` for an expired quote.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Enable **[!UICONTROL Companies]** and **[!UICONTROL Purchase Orders]**.
    
     * **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL General]** > **[!UICONTROL B2B Features]** and set **[!UICONTROL Enable Company]** to *Yes*.
     
     * **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL General]** > **[!UICONTROL B2B Features]** > **[!UICONTROL Order Approval Configuration]** and set **[!UICONTROL Enable Purchase Orders]** to *Yes*.
1. Create a new company and set **[!UICONTROL Enable Purchase Orders]** to *Yes* for the same.
1. Create a simple product and assign it to a category.
1. Log in to Storefront using the company Admin account and create a new order using **[!UICONTROL Purchase Order]** as the payment method.
1. Change the **[!UICONTROL Quote Lifetime (days)]**.
    * **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL Sales]** > **[!UICONTROL Checkout]** > **[!UICONTROL Shopping Cart]** > **[!UICONTROL Quote Lifetime (days)]** = *0*.
1. Run the command `bin/magento c:f`.
1. Go to the DB `quote_table` and change the `created_at` and `updated_at` values with one day in the past.
1. Run the command `bin/magento cron:run --group="sales_clean_quotes`.
1. Execute the GraphQL request given below using an authorized token for the Admin who creates the **[!UICONTROL Purchase Order]**:

   ```GraphQL
   {
       customer {
           purchase_order(uid: "MQ==") {
               quote {
                   id
               }
           }
       }
   } 
   ```

<u>Expected results</u>:

The GraphQL query returns the `quote_id`.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The GraphQL query returns an internal server error.
