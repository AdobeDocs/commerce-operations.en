## Issue

A GraphQL query returns an error when the same product is assigned to multiple configurable products.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a simple product with an attribute *color*.
1. Create *2* configurable products and assigned the simple product from step *1*.
1. Run the GraphQL query (filtering the products by the `url_key` of the configurable products).

```GraphQL
{
  products(filter: { url_key: { in : ["configurable-1", "configurable-2"] } }) {
    items {
      id
      attribute_set_id
      name
      sku
      __typename
      price_range{
        minimum_price{
          regular_price{
            value
            currency
          }
        }
      }
      categories {
        id
      }
      ... on ConfigurableProduct {
        configurable_options {
          id
          attribute_id_v2
          label
          position
          use_default
          attribute_code
          values {
            value_index
            label
          }
          product_id
        }
        variants {
          product {
            id
            name
            sku
            attribute_set_id
            ... on PhysicalProductInterface {
              weight
            }
            price_range{
              minimum_price{
                regular_price{
                  value
                  currency
                }
              }
            }
          }
          attributes {
            uid
            label
            code
            value_index
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<u>Expected results</u>:

The GraphQL query returns no errors.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The GraphQL query returns an error.
