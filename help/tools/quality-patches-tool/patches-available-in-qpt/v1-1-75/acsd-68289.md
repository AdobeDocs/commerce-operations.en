# ACSD-68289: No results when minimum match condition is met across all searchable fields

The ACSD-68289 patch fixes the issue where full-text search matches products across all searchable fields collectively, rather than requiring a single field to satisfy all search terms. This patch is available when the [[!DNL Quality Patches Tool (QPT)]](/help/tools/quality-patches-tool/quality-patches-tool-to-self-serve-quality-patches.md) 1.1.75 is installed.

## Issue

Full‑text search returns products when the minimum match requirement is met across multiple fields, instead of requiring all terms to match in a single field.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a product attribute:
   * **[!UICONTROL Default Label]**: *Model Year*
   * **[!UICONTROL Catalog Input Type for Store Owner]**: *Text Field*
   * **[!UICONTROL Use In Search]**: *Yes*
1. Add the attribute to the default attribute set.
1. Create a product:
   * **[!UICONTROL Product Name]**: *Honda Jazz GDI*
   * **[!UICONTROL Model Year]**: *2008*
1. In the  **[!UICONTROL Admin]** panel, go to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** > **[!UICONTROL Catalog Search]**. Set **[!UICONTROL Minimum Terms to Match]** under search settings to *3<-1 5<50%*.
1. Run full reindex.
1. In the storefront, search for *2008 honda*.

<u>Expected result</u>:

The newly created product appears in the search results.

<u>Actual result</u>:

No search results returned.
