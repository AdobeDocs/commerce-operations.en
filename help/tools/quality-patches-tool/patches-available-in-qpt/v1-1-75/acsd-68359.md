## Issue

**Prerequisites:**

2. Go to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL B2B Features]** > **[!UICONTROL General Settings]** and enable **[!UICONTROL Company]** and **[!UICONTROL Quick Order]**.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Add 100+ products to the cart using **[!UICONTROL Quick Order]**.
1. Proceed to checkout and select **[!UICONTROL Pick in Store]**.
1. Observe the *414* error returned by the **[!UICONTROL Search for pickup location]** endpoint.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The **[!UICONTROL Search for pickup location]** endpoint functions correctly regardless of the number of products in the cart.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The **[!UICONTROL Search for pickup location]** endpoint returns a 414 error when the cart contains around 100 products.
