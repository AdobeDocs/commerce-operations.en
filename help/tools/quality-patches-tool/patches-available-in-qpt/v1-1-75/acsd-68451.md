## Issue

In a multi‑website setup, a company admin logs in to one website and creates a company. Then, in the same browser, the admin opens another website and creates a different company. The platform incorrectly associates the second company admin with the first company, even though the companies remain unrelated.

<u>Prerequisites</u>:

Install [!DNL B2B] and Inventory.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create an additional website, store, and store view.
1. Enable *[!UICONTROL Company]* under **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL General]** > **[!UICONTROL B2B Features]**.
1. Access the default website on the storefront.
1. Create a new company on the storefront and sign in as the company administrator.
1. In the same browser session, access the secondary website.
1. Create a new company on the storefront for the secondary website.
1. Log in to the Admin panel and verify the customer grid.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The new company admin remains assigned only to the newly created company, even when another company admin stays logged in on a different website in the same browser.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The new company admin also gets assigned to the other company as a **Company User**, in addition to the intended company.
