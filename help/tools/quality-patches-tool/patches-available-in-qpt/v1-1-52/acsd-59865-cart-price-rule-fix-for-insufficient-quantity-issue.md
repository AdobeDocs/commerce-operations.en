## Issue

The [!UICONTROL Cart Price Rule] fails to cancel previously applied rules due to an insufficient product quantity in the cart.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Log in as an admin.
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Marketing]** > **[!UICONTROL Cart Price Rules]** and click on **[!UICONTROL Add New rule]**.
    * Set **[!UICONTROL Rule Name]** = *Test - 1*
    * Select all *Websites* and *Customer groups*
    * Set **[!UICONTROL Priority]** = *0*
    * Go to the **[!UICONTROL Actions]** section:
        * Set **[!UICONTROL Apply]** = *Percent of product price discount*
        * Set **[!UICONTROL Discount amount]** = *10*
        * Set **[!UICONTROL Maximum Qty Discount is Applied To]** = *100*
        * Set **[!UICONTROL Discount Qty Step (Buy X)]** = *0*
        * Set **[!UICONTROL Discard subsequent rules]** to *No*
1. Clear the cache.
1. Go to the Storefront, add one item to the cart, and proceed to *checkout/cart*.
1. Verify that the *10%* discount is applied to your cart.
1. Return to the **[!UICONTROL Cart Price Rules]** and create a new rule.
    * Set **[!UICONTROL Rule Name]** = *Test - 2*
    * Select all **[!UICONTROL Websites]** and **[!UICONTROL Customer Groups]**
    * Set **[!UICONTROL Priority]** = *2*
    * Navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Actions]** section:
        * Set **[!UICONTROL Apply]** = *Percent of product price discount*
        * Set **[!UICONTROL Discount amount]** = *20*
        * Set **[!UICONTROL Maximum Qty Discount is Applied To]** = *100*
        * Set **[!UICONTROL Discount Qty Step (Buy X)]** = *3*
1. Clear the cache.
1. Go back to the Storefront again.
1. Update the cart to refresh the rules. Verify that the *10%* discount is no longer applied.
1. Add items to your cart until the quantity meets the *Step* value required for the second rule.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The first cart price rule is applied when the second rule's conditions are met.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Price rules are applied as configured in the admin dashboard.
