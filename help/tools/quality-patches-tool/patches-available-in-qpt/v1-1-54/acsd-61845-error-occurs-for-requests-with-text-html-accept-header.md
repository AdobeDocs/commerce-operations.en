## Issue

When sending an HTTP request with only *text/html* in the accept header, a 500 error occurs due to a mismatch in the media type configuration.

<u>Prerequisites</u>:

B2B modules are installed and enabled.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Send a request with only *text/html* in the accept header, as follows:

    ```shell
    curl -I --header "Accept: text/html, text/plain" http://<hostname>/pub/
    ```

<u>Expected results</u>:

The page is returned with a *200 status code*.

<u>Actual results</u>:

A 500 error is returned, with the following error message in the `exception.log`:

```text
Magento\Framework\Webapi\Exception: Server cannot match any of the given Accept HTTP header media type(s) from the request: "text/html" with media types from the config of response renderer. in vendor/magento/framework/Webapi/Rest/Response/RendererFactory.php:84
