## Issue

The `async.operations.all` consumer stops processing messages if a B2B company is created asynchronously while the consumer is still running.

<u>Prerequisites</u>:

B2B modules are installed and enabled.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create two customers.
1. Send a REST bulk request to create two companies, assigning the created customers as company administrators.
1. Start the consumer using the following command:

    `bin/magento queue:consumer:start async.operations.all --max-messages=20000`

<u>Expected results</u>:

The consumer processes 20,000 messages and ends successfully.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The consumer stops working immediately upon execution.
