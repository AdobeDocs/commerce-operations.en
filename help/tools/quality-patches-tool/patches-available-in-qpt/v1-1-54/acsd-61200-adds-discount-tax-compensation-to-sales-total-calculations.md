## Issue

Inaccuracies in the sales order and coupon report data due to missing *[!UICONTROL Discount Tax Compensation Amount]* and *[!UICONTROL Shipping Discount Tax Compensation Amount]* in sales total calculations.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a [!UICONTROL Tax Zone] and a [!UICONTROL Tax Rule].
1. Set the following tax configurations:
    - **[!UICONTROL Tax Class for Shipping]** = [!UICONTROL Taxable Goods]
    - **[!UICONTROL Catalog Prices]** = [!UICONTROL Including Tax]
    - **[!UICONTROL Shipping Prices]** = [!UICONTROL Including Tax]
    - **[!UICONTROL Apply Discount on Prices]** = [!UICONTROL Including Tax]
    - **[!UICONTROL Display Product Prices in Catalog]** = [!UICONTROL Including Tax]
    - **[!UICONTROL Display Shipping Prices]** = [!UICONTROL Including Tax]
1. Update the following display settings for Orders, Invoices, and Credit memos:
    - **[!UICONTROL Display Prices]** = [!UICONTROL Including Tax]
    - **[!UICONTROL Display Subtotal]**= [!UICONTROL Including Tax]
    - **[!UICONTROL Display Shipping Amount]** = [!UICONTROL Including Tax]
1. Create a [!UICONTROL Cart Price Rule] with a coupon for a 10% discount.
1. Complete an order using the coupon and generate an invoice and shipment.
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Reports]** > **[!UICONTROL Sales]** > **[!UICONTROL Coupons]** and generate a report.
1. Compare the data in the order summary to that of the report.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The *[!UICONTROL Total Amount]* and *[!UICONTROL Total Amount Actual]* calculations include both *[!UICONTROL Discount Tax Compensation Amount]* and *[!UICONTROL Shipping Discount Tax Compensation Amount]*, matching the order summary with the report data.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Sales order data and coupon report data do not match because the *[!UICONTROL Discount Tax Compensation Amount]* and *[!UICONTROL Shipping Discount Tax Compensation Amount]* are missing from calculations.
