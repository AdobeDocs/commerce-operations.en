## Issue

The invoice with FPT shows a wrong grand total when the order is paid with store credit.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a customer and make sure that the customer has store credit enough to cover the order.
1. Enable FPT and add FPT to a product.
1. From the front end, log in as the customer just created.
1. Add the product with FPT to the cart.
1. Checkout and pay with store credit. It should be a zero pay order.
1. Go to Orders and manually invoice the order.
1. Check the invoice grand total.

<u>Expected results</u>:

* The invoice grand total is zero.
* The order total paid amount is zero.

<u>Actual results</u>:

* The invoice grand total still shows the FPT amount.
* The total paid still shows the FPT amount.
