## Issue

GraphQL does not return related products when the shared catalog is enabled.

<u>Prerequisites</u>:

B2B modules must be installed.
The instance must be clean with only the sample data.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Go to **Stores** > **Configuration** > **General** > **B2B features** and enable **Company and Shared Catalog**.
1. Go to **Catalog** > **Shared Catalog** and add all the products to the **General Catalog**.
1. Use the sample data and modify the Joust Duffle Bag (SKU 24-MB01).
1. Under **Related Products**, add the two Duffle bags (ID 7 and 13).
1. Send a **Post** request:

<pre>{
  products(filter: {sku: {eq: "24-MB01"}}, sort: {name: ASC}) {
    items {
      related_products {
        uid
        name
      }
    }
  }
}</pre>

<u>Expected results</u>:

Related products is shown in the GraphQL response.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Users get the following error:

<pre>Return value of Magento\CatalogPermissionsGraphQl\Model\Store\StoreProcessor::getStoreId() must be of the type int, null returned {"exception":"[object] (GraphQL\\Error\\Error(code: 0): Return value of Magento\\CatalogPermissionsGraphQl\\Model\\Store\\StoreProcessor::getStoreId() must be of the type int, null returned </pre>
