## Issue

Searching by SKU in B2B quick order functionality is case-sensitive and shows an error when a different case is used than the one with which the SKU is saved.

<u>Prerequisites</u>:

B2B modules are installed.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Log in to the admin and go to **Stores** > **Configuration** > **B2B**.
1. Enable **Shared Catalog** and **Quick Order**.
1. Create a product with uppercase SKU, e.g., TEST20-1234
1. Assign created product to the **Shared Catalog**.
1. Log in as a customer and click on **Quick Order**.
1. Enter the SKU in lowercase, e.g., test20-1234.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The product should be found irrespective of the case used.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The following error message is received: *1 product(s) require(s) your attention*.
