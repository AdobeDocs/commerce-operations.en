<u>Expected results</u>:

* There is no deadlocks.
* Performance is not decreased in cases when several parallel orders are placed.

<u>Actual results</u>:

* Placing an order is extremely slow when there are multiple concurrent users.
* Deadlock errors occur which look like the following:

```SQL
"SQLSTATE[40001]: Serialization failure: 1213 Deadlock found when trying to get lock; try restarting transaction, query was:
INSERT INTO `quote_payment` (`quote_id`, `method`, `additional_information`) VALUES (?, ?, ?)"
```
