## Issue

"Not visible individually" configurable child products are returned in GraphQL response and slow MySQL query for GraphQL products query with category filter.

<u>Prerequisites</u>:

B2B modules must be installed.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a configurable product with simple products set to **Not visible individually**.
1. Run a **full reindex**.
1. Run a **GraphQL query** like:

<pre>query getFilteredProducts(
  $filter: ProductAttributeFilterInput!
  $sort: ProductAttributeSortInput!
  $search: String
  $pageSize: Int!
  $currentPage: Int!
) {
  products(
    filter: $filter
    sort: $sort
    search: $search
    pageSize: $pageSize
    currentPage: $currentPage
  ) {
    total_count
    page_info {
      total_pages
      current_page
      page_size
    }
    items {
      name
      sku
    }
  }
}</pre>

Variables:

<pre>{"filter":{"user_group":{"eq":""}},"search":"config-100","sort":{},"pageSize":200,"currentPage":1}
</pre>

<u>Expected results</u>:

Products with visibility set to "Not visible individually" won't be returned in response.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Products with visiblility set to "Not visible individually" are returned in response.
