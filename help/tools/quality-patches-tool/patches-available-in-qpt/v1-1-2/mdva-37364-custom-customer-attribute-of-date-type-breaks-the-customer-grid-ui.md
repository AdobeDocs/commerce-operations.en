    * Set the Input Type to Date.
    * Set the Add to Column Options to Yes.
    * Save the attribute.
1. Go to **Admin** > **Customers** > **All Customers**.
    * Add the newly added custom attribute to the grid from the columns option.
1. Create/Edit a customer and set the value of the created custom date attribute field.
1. Save, reindex, and clear cache.
1. Go to **Customers** > **All Customers**.
    * Check the Customer Grid.
