## Issue

The user is not able to set shipping address on the carts with an empty telephone number via GraphQL despite the fact that the Show Telephone is configured as optional.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a simple product.
1. Go to **Stores** > **Configuration** > **Customers** > **Customer Configuration** > **Name and Address Options** and set the Show Telephone as Optional.
1. Create an empty cart via GraphQL request.

    ```GraphQL
    mutation {
    createEmptyCart
    }
    ```

1. Add product to cart.

    ```GraphQL
    mutation {
    addSimpleProductsToCart(
    input: {
      cart_id: "{ CART_ID }"
      cart_items: [
        {
          data: {
            quantity: 1
            sku: "24-MG04"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ) {
    cart {
      items {
        id
        product {
          sku
          stock_status
        }
        quantity
      }
    }
    }
    }
    ```

1. Add address: GRAPHQL VARIABLES.

    ```GraphQL
    {
      "cartId": "6Efw00UbjPoP5cvTFhsswDTjpxs0Xupt"
    }
    ```

    ```GraphQL
    mutation ($cartId: String!) {
      setShippingAddressesOnCart(input: {cart_id: $cartId, shipping_addresses:
      {address: {firstname: "John", lastname: "Doe", company: "Company Name",
      street: ["820 Burrard Street"], city: "Vancouver", region: "BC", postcode: "V6Z 2J1",
      country_code: "CA", telephone: "123-456-0000", save_in_address_book: false}}}) {
        cart {
          shipping_addresses {
            firstname
            lastname
            company
            street
            city
            postcode
            telephone
            country {
              code
              label
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Result:

    ```GraphQL
      {
          "data": {
              "setShippingAddressesOnCart": {
                  "cart": {
                      "shipping_addresses": [
                          {
                              "firstname": "John",

                          }
                      ]
                  }
              }
          }
      }
    ```

1. Add address with empty phone number.

    ```GraphQL
    mutation ($cartId: String!) {
      setShippingAddressesOnCart(input: {cart_id: $cartId, shipping_addresses: {address: {firstname:
        "John", lastname: "Canada", company: "Company Name", street: ["820 Burrard Street"], city:
        "Vancouver", region: "BC", postcode: "V6Z 2J1", country_code: "CA", telephone: "123-456-0000",
        save_in_address_book: false}}}) {
        cart {
          shipping_addresses {
            firstname
            lastname
            company
            street
            city
            postcode
            telephone
            country {
              code
              label
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
