## Issue

GraphQL returns configurable child products even after they are disabled at the website level.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Enable display out of stock products option under **Store** > **Configuration** > **Catalog** > **Inventory** > **Stock Options** > **Display Out of Stock Products** > **Yes**.
1. Select any **Configurable Product** which has more than two **Simple Products**.
1. Disable **Simple Product** and save the **Configurable Product**.
1. Fetch the **Configurable Product** data using GraphQL.

<pre>
  <code class="language-graphql">
{
  products(filter: { sku: { eq: "cp1" } }) {
    items {
      __typename
      name
      sku
      ... on ConfigurableProduct {
        variants {
          product {
            __typename
            name
            sku
            color
            stock_status
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
</code>
</pre>

<u>Expected results</u>:

Disabled products are NOT shown in the variant results.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Disabled products data is fetched in the variant results.
