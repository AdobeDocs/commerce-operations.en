## Issue

Products are incorrectly sorted when using multiple sort attributes in [!DNL GraphQL].

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a few products with different prices and names.
1. Create a category and assign the created products to it.
1. Send a [!DNL GraphQL] products query for the created category with a few *sort* attributes. For example:
   
    ```
    {
    products(
      currentPage: 1
      pageSize: 10
      filter: {
        category_id: {
          eq :"3"
        }
      }
      sort: {  price: DESC, name: ASC, position: ASC
      }
    ){
    items{
      name
      sku
            
        price_range {
            minimum_price {
          
          regular_price {
            value
            currency
          }
          final_price {
            value
            currency
          }
          discount {
            amount_off
            percent_off
          }
                }
            }
       }
      }
     }
    ```

1. Check the response after creating *sort* attributes.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The products should be returned in the correct order. Sorting the products by multiple attributes should work.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The products are not returned in the correct order. Sorting the products by multiple attributes doesn't work.
