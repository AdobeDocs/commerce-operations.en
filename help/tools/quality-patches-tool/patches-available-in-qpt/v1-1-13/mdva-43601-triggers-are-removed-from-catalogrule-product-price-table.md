<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Set all the indexers to *Update by Schedule*.
1. Check the triggers created for `catalogrule_product_price` table by running the following SQL request:

    ```sql
    show triggers like '%catalogrule_%'\G
    ```

1. Manually reindex `catalogrule_rule` or `catalogrule_product` by running the following command: `bin/magento indexer:reindex catalogrule_rule`
1. Check the triggers of `catalogrule_product_price` table again.

<u>Expected results</u>:

Triggers in `catalogrule_product_price` table are preserved after a full reindex.

<u>Actual results</u>:
