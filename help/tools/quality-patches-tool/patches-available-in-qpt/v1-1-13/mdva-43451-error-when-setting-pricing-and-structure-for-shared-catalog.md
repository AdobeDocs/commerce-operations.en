    +----------+----------------+------------+----------+--------------------+
    | store_id | code           | website_id | group_id | name               |
    +----------+----------------+------------+----------+--------------------+
    |        0 | admin          |          0 |        0 | Admin              |
    |        1 | default        |          1 |        1 | Default Store View |
    |        3 | web1storeview2 |          2 |        2 | web1storeview2     |
    |        4 | web1storeview3 |          2 |        2 | web1storeview3     |
