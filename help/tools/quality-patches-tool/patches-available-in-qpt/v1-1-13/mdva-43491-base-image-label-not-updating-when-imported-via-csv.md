## Issue

The `base_image_label` doesn't update when imported using a CSV file for a multi-store website.

<u>Prerequisites</u>:

One or more existing non-default websites, stores, and store views.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a new product.

    * Upload an image.
    * Assign the product to the newly created websites.

1. Export the product as CSV.
1. Update the `base_image_label` for each store view by duplicating the default row of the CSV file.
1. Import the CSV file. It will update the labels for each store correctly, which can be verified under the **Images and Videos** tab on the product edit page.
1. Export the CSV file again and update the `base_image_label` column with different values.
1. Import the CSV file again.
1. Open the product in the Admin and check if the label has been updated for each store view.

<u>Expected results</u>:

Alt Text (image label) is updated with the store-specific value as per the CSV file.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Alt Text (image label) is not updated with the `base_image_label` value in the CSV file.
