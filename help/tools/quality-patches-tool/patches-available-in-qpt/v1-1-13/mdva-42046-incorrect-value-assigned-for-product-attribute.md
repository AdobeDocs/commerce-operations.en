## Issue

After saving a product with `news_from_date` and/or `news_to_date` fields, the values from those fields reset to default.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a simple product.
1. Export the product created in step one.
1. In the exported CSV file, put some values in the `news_from_date` and `news_to_date` fields. For example, 2021-05-15 and 2021-06-18.
1. Import the product using the modified CSV file.
1. Add additional columns "Set Product as New from Date" and "Set Product as New to Date" to the product grid.
1. Open the edit page for the product, and without any changes, click **Save**.
1. Go back to the product grid and check the data for the product.

<u>Expected results</u>:

Both "Set Product as New from Date" and "Set Product as New to Date" are the same as before saving.

<u>Actual results</u>:

* Values in the "Set Product as New from Date" and "Set Product as New to Date" columns are changed.

* The "Set Product as New from Date" column shows the current date, and the "Set Product as New to Date" column is empty.
