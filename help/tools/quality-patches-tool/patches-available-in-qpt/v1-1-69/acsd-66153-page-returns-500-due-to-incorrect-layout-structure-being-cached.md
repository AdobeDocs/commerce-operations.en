## Issue

A page returns a 500 error because of a cached incorrect layout structure.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Install `2.4-develop.
1. Create and install custom module
    1.1 Add a custom block to the `catalog_category_view` layout.
    1.1 Inject `Magento\Framework\View\Result\Layout` into the custom block through its constructor.
1. Create the category **[!UICONTROL shop]**.
1. Open **[!UICONTROL two terminal windows]**:
    1. **Terminal 1**: Continuously clean the layout cache:

   ```
    for i in {1..200}; do
      bin/magento cache:clean layout
    done
   ```
   
    1. **Terminal 2**: Simulate concurrent requests to the category page:

   ```
   for i in {1..200}; do
      curl -s -o /dev/null -w "Request $i: HTTP %{http_code}\n" "http://your_magento_base_url/shop.html?req=$i"
    done
   ```
1. Some requests randomly fail with a 500 status code. The var/log/support_report.log file shows errors like:Â 
{noformat}
report.CRITICAL: The element with the "root" ID wasn't found. Verify the ID and try again. [] []{noformat}

<u>Expected results</u>:

All requests should return 200 OK.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Some requests intermittently return 500 Internal Server Error.
