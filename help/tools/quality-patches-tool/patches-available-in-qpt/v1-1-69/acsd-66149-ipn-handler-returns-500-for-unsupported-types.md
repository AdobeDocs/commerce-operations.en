## Issue

Issue where the IPN handler returns a 500 error for unsupported or unknown IPN types.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

Issue only happens when Paypal sends IPN with some fields missing.
For testing purposes we have to create a custom module that will emulate all kinds of unknown IPN types from PayPal.
Create at least one product
Configure PayPal Express with your own credentials
Place an order with Paypal Express
Run PayPal emulator

<u>Expected results</u>:

Application IPN handler should ignore incorrect IPN types and do not generate 500 errors:
Order 000000001: Status processing â€” HTTP 500

<u>Actual results</u>:

Application generates tons of 500 errors during processing incorrect IPNs and sporadically doesn't process some orders if expected fields are absent
