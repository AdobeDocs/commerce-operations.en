## Issue

The issue is the IPN handler returns a *500* error for unsupported or unknown IPN types. It occurs when Paypal sends IPN with some fields missing.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a custom module that will emulate all kinds of unknown IPN types from PayPal.
1. Create at least one product.
1. Configure PayPal Express with your own credentials.
1. Place an order with Paypal Express.
1. Run the PayPal emulator.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The application IPN handler ignores incorrect IPN types and doesn't generate *500* errors:
```Order 000000001: Status processing â€” HTTP 500```

<u>Actual results</u>:

The application generates many *500* errors during processing incorrect IPNs and sporadically doesn't process some orders if the expected fields are absent.
