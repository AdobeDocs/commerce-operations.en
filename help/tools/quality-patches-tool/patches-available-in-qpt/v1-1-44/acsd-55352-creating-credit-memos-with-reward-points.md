## Issue

After creating a partial credit memo with customer reward points, the order status changes to *closed* and credit memo options disappear from the admin order page.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Log in to the Adobe Commerce Admin.
2. Go to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Other Setting]** > **[!UICONTROL Reward Exchange Rates]** > **[!UICONTROL Add New Rate]**.
3. Add two rates:
    * *[!UICONTROL First]*:
        * *[!UICONTROL Direction]* = *Points to Currency* 
        * *[!UICONTROL Rate]* = *100*
        * *[!UICONTROL Upper Boundary]* = *100*
    * *[!UICONTROL Second]*:
        * *[!UICONTROL Direction]* = *Currency to Points*
        * *[!UICONTROL Rate]* = *100*
        * *[!UICONTROL Upper Boundary]* = *100* 
4. Create a simple product with the price of *$100* and with *Qty* : *100*.
5. Create a customer from the storefront.
6. Go to the backend again : **[!UICONTROL Customers]** > **[!UICONTROL All Customers]** > **[!UICONTROL Edit]** > **[!UICONTROL Reward Points]** > **[!UICONTROL Update Points]** > Add *100* and save the customer.
7. Go to the storefront and log in as the customer created previously.
8. Add the product to cart with *Qty* : *10*.
9. Go to **[!UICONTROL Checkout]** and use the available *100* reward points when prompted and place the order.
10. Go to **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Sales]** > **[!UICONTROL Orders]** > **[!UICONTROL Invoice]** and ship that order.
11. Go to [!UICONTROL Credit Memo] and update the *Qty to Refund* to *8*.
12. Tick the **[!UICONTROL Refund Reward Points]** checkbox and  click **[!UICONTROL Refund offline]**.
13. Try to refund the other two remaining products from the order, using the [!UICONTROL Credit Memo].

<u>Expected results</u>:

* The Admin creates [!UICONTROL Credit Memo] to return the remaining two products.
* The order status is *Completed*.

<u>Actual results</u>:

* Cannot create more [!UICONTROL Credit Memo].
* The order status is *Closed*.
