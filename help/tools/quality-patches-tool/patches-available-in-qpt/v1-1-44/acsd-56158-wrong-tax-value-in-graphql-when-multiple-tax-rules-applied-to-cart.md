## Issue

The tax value rendering in the GraphQL response is incorrect when multiple tax rules are applied to the cart.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a customer with a US address.
1. Navigate to the Admin Panel.
1. Create a product with a price of $100.
1. Create two tax rates for the US address: one for 10% and the other for 5%.
1. Configure two tax rules for USA from **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Taxes]** > **[!UICONTROL Tax Rule]**.
1. Assign one tax rate to one rule.
1. From the frontend, log in as the customer with the US address, and add the product to the cart.
1. Generate a customer token via GraphQL.
1. Generate a cart ID via GraphQL.
1. Check that the tax applied is correct by getting the customer's cart via GraphQL:

    ```GraphQL
    {
        cart(cart_id: "o3Yqt6zkn8ncOzFxGnR1IWdT..") {
            id

                    value
                    currency
                }
                subtotal_excluding_tax {
                    value
                    currency
                }
                subtotal_including_tax {
                    value
                    currency
                }
                applied_taxes {
                    label
                    amount {
                        currency
                        value
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }    
    ```

<u>Expected results</u>:

Each tax rate shows its own tax amount:

```
"applied_taxes": [
    {
        "label": "US-CA-*-Rate 1",
        "amount": {
            "currency": "USD",
            "value": 10
        }
    },
    {
        "label": "US-CA-*-Rate 2",
        "amount": {
            "currency": "USD",
            "value": 5
        }
    }
]
```

<u>Actual results</u>:

Total tax amount returned for each rule:

```
"applied_taxes": [
    {
        "label": "US-CA-*-Rate 1",
        "amount": {
            "currency": "USD",
            "value": 15
        }
    },
    {
        "label": "US-CA-*-Rate 2",
        "amount": {
            "currency": "USD",
            "value": 15
        }
    }
]
```
