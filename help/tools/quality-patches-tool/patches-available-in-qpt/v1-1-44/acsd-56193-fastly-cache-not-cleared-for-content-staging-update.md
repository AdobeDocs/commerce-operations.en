## Issue

The [!DNL Fastly/Varnish] cache is not cleared for content staging update

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Install and configure [!DNL Varnish] cache.
1. Create a static block with a scheduled update.
1. Create a category embedding the static block. 
1. Fetch the content of the category using the below GraphQL query:

    ```GraphQL
       query GetCategories($id: String!) {
          categoryList(filters: { category_uid: { eq: $id } }) 
        {
            meta_title
            meta_keywords
            meta_description
            description
            path
            cms_block {
              content
              identifier
              title
              __typename
            }
            __typename
        }
      }
      {"id":"Mwo="}
    ```

1. Run this query multiple times and make sure the response is cached in the [!DNL Varnish].
1. Run the cron to apply the scheduled change.
1. Run the above GraphQL query again.
1. Create a new schedule for the same static block.
1. Repeat the steps numbered 5-9.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The updated content is returned after the scheduled updates run.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The outdated content is returned after the scheduled updates run.
