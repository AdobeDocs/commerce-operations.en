## Issue

Widget content is not updating on the CMS page. 

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a few products.
1. Create the new CMS page and add new products widget to the content:

    ```
       {{widget type="Magento\Catalog\Block\Product\Widget\NewWidget" display_type="new_products" show_pager="1" products_per_page="5" products_count="10" template="product/widget/new/content/new_grid.phtml" page_var_name="pnetpm"}} 
    ```

1. Open the created page on the storefront. Make sure to cache it.
1. From the Admin, open **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** > **[!UICONTROL Products]**.
1. Pick any product for edit and switch **[!UICONTROL Set Product as New]** to *Yes*.
1. Go to the created *CMS page* on the storefront again.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The page contains *New Products widget* with the products.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The page does not contain *New Products widget*, and the new products do not appear.
