## Issue

When an admin user with restricted access adds a product by SKU outside their access in the order, an exception occurs instead of a message notifying the user of their limited access.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Log into the admin as a user with access to only a specific website.
1. Go to **Sales** > **Orders** and click **Create New Order**.
1. Select a customer and a store view.
1. Click on **Add Products by SKU**.
1. Search for an SKU that is not assigned to any website or not assigned to the website for which you have access.
1. Click **Add to Order**.

<u>Expected results</u>:

An appropriate error message is displayed.

<u>Actual results</u>:

An exception occurs.
