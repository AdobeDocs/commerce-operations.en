## Issue

Discount is incorrectly applied to a bundled child product.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a simple product with price of 50$.
1. Create a bundled product, and assign the simple product as the only option for the bundled product.
1. Create a Cart Price Rule with:

    * Condition: If the total amount is greater than 130$
    * Action: Fixed amount discount of 10$ is applied

1. Go to the storefront and add the bundle product to the cart with qty = 1.
1. Go to the cart and check that the total cost of the bundle product is 50$ and the discount doesn't apply.
1. Change quantity to 2 and update the cart. The total cost of the bundled product should now be 100$.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The discount is not applied because the subtotal is 100\$, which is less than 130\$ in the rule condition.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The discount is applied.
