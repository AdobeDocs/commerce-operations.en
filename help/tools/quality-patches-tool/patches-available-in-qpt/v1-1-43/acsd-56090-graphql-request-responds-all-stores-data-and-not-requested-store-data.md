## Issue

GraphQL response contains all stores data instead of the store specific data.

1. Each Root category should have one sub-category.
1. Navigate to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL All stores]** > Two stores exists with different root categories for each of it. (Each Stores should have at least one store view)
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** > **[!UICONTROL Products]** > create a product with

* All the root and sub categories assigned
* All websites assigned.

1. Execute the GraphqQL query (add header â€” store = 'storename ):

```
   query {
     products(filter: { url_key: { eq: "abc" } }) {
       items {
         categories {
           name
           id
           url_path
           breadcrumbs {
             category_id
             category_name
             category_level
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
```

1. Check the response after executing the GraphqQL query.

<u>Expected results</u>:

<u>Actual results</u>:
