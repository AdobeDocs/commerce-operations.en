    * [!UICONTROL Tax Classes]:

        * [!UICONTROL Tax Class for Shipping] = [!UICONTROL Taxable Goods]
        * [!UICONTROL Tax Class for Gift Options] = [!UICONTROL Taxable Goods]

    * [!UICONTROL Calculation Settings]:

        * [!UICONTROL Catalog Prices] = [!UICONTROL Including Tax]
        * [!UICONTROL Shipping Prices] = [!UICONTROL Including Tax]
        * [!UICONTROL Apply Discount On Prices] = [!UICONTROL Including Tax]

    * [!UICONTROL Default Tax Destination Calculation]:

        * [!UICONTROL Default Post Code] = *
    
    * [!UICONTROL Price Display Settings]:

        * [!UICONTROL Display Product Prices In Catalog] = [!UICONTROL Including Tax]
        * [!UICONTROL Display Shipping Prices] = [!UICONTROL Including Tax]
    
    * [!UICONTROL Shopping Cart Display Settings]:

        * [!UICONTROL Display Prices] = [!UICONTROL Including Tax]
        * [!UICONTROL Display Subtotal] = [!UICONTROL Including Tax]
        * [!UICONTROL Display Shipping Amount] = [!UICONTROL Including Tax]

1. Set **[!UICONTROL Shipping Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Origin]** > **[!UICONTROL Country]** = *United Kingdom*.

1. Create the following *[!UICONTROL Tax Rate]* and *[!UICONTROL Tax Rules]*:

    * [!UICONTROL Country] = United States
    * [!UICONTROL Zip Code] = *
    * [!UICONTROL State] = *
    * [!UICONTROL Rate] = 20%
1. Create a simple product and set the following:
    * [!UICONTROL Price = 110]
    * [!UICONTROL Special Price = 100]
    * In the drop-down, set type to custom option with price set to 15%
1. Go to the product page for the simple item made on the storefront.
1. Choose the custom option created, *15%*.

<u>Expected results</u>:
