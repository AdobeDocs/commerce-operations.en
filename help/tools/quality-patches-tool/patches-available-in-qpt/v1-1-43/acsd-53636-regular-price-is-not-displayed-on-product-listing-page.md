## Issue

The regular price is not displayed on *[!UICONTROL Product Listing]* pages for configurable products that have child products with special prices.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Log in to the admin and go to **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Catalog]**, and create or open any configurable product.
2. Open the child product and add a special price to all or one of the child products and save the product.
3. Go to frontend and open the **[!UICONTROL Product Detail]** page of the configurable product; on the swatches of the child product with special price, you will see the *[!UICONTROL Regular price]* striked out (expected).
4. Go to frontend and open the **[!UICONTROL Product Listing]** page for the configurable product with special price; see that the configurable product swatch changes don't display the regular price unlike the *[!UICONTROL Product Detail Page]* and other simple products.

<u>Expected results</u>:

On the *[!UICONTROL Product Listing]* page, the configurable product shows the regular price for its child product.

<u>Actual results</u>:

On the *[!UICONTROL Product Listing]* page, the configurable product does not show the regular price for its child product.
