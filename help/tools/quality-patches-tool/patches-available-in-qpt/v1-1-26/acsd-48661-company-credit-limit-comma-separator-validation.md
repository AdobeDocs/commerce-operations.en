## Issue

When the company credit limit is larger than 999, the comma separator prevents the company from saving due to a validation error.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Enable the company feature at **[!UICONTROL Store]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL General]** > **[!UICONTROL B2B Features]**.
1. Create a company and add a credit limit larger than 999 under the **[!UICONTROL Company Credit]** tab.
1. Save the company.
1. Edit the company and try to save it again.

<u>Expected results</u>:

You are able to save the company without fixing the credit limit. Comma is not supported for input fields for the amounts and prices.

<u>Actual results</u>:

You are not able to save the company due to a validation error in the *[!UICONTROL Credit Limit]* field. Adobe Commerce automatically adds comma separators for credit limits even though the [!UICONTROL Credit Limit] field does not accept commas.
