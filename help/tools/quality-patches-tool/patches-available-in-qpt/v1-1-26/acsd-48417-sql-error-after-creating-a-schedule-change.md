## Issue

An SQL error appears after creating a schedule change for a product and saving another product.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Install Magento 2.4-develop EE + Sample Data.
1. Go to the admin panel > **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** > **[!UICONTROL Products]**.
1. Edit any product (e.g., Joust Duffle Bag [SKU: 24-MB01]).
1. Schedule a new update:
    * Select **[!UICONTROL Save as a New Update]**
    * Update name: "Update 1"
    * Start Date: current time +1 min
    * End Date: current time +1 hour
    * Modify Product name to: "Joust Duffle Bag 2"
    * Save the product.
1. Go to CLI and execute cron and wait till the schedule is applied.

    ```
    bin/magento cron:run && bin/magento cron:run
    ```

1. Again, go to **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** > **[!UICONTROL Products]** and edit any configurable product (e.g., Chaz Kangeroo Hoodie [SKU: MH01]).

    * Disable all variants. Go to the Actions column > **[!UICONTROL Select]** > **[!UICONTROL Disable Product]**.
    * Save the configurable one.

<u>Expected results</u>:

No error upon saving the product.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The following error occurs:

```SQL
SQLSTATE[23000]: Integrity constraint violation: 1048 Column 'sku' cannot be null, query was: INSERT INTO `catalog_product_entity` (`entity_id`, `sku`, `row_id`, `created_in`, `updated_in`) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
