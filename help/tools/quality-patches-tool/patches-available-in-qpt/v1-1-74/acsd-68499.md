## Issue

Issue where GraphQL updateCartItems mutation returns incorrect success response when updating quantities that exceed available stock, showing inflated quantities and totals.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create an empty cart
1. Add a product with limited stock (e.g., 10 units available) to the cart
1. Query the cart and note the cart_item_id
1. Attempt to update the cart item quantity to 100 (exceeding available stock of 10):

```
mutation ($cart: String!, $cartItemId: Int!, $quantity: Float!) {
  updateCartItems(
    input: {
      cart_id: $cart
      cart_items: [{ cart_item_id: $cartItemId, quantity: $quantity }]
    }
  ) {
    cart {
      items {
        product {
          name
        }
        quantity
      }
      prices {
        grand_total {
          value
          currency
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

1. Query the cart again to verify actual quantity

<u>Expected results</u>:

Stock validation should prevent invalid quantity updates

<u>Actual results</u>:

updateCartItems mutation returns SUCCESS with quantity 100
