## Issue

The [!DNL GraphQL] `updateCartItems` mutation in Adobe Commerce incorrectly returns **SUCCESS** response when updating quantities beyond available stock, causing inflated cart totals and quantities.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create an empty cart.
1. Add a product with limited stock (for example, 10 units available) to the cart.
1. Query the cart and note the `cart_item_id`.
1. Update the cart item quantity to 100 (exceeds available stock of 10) using the following mutation:

```
mutation ($cart: String!, $cartItemId: Int!, $quantity: Float!) {
  updateCartItems(
    input: {
      cart_id: $cart
      cart_items: [{ cart_item_id: $cartItemId, quantity: $quantity }]
    }
  ) {
    cart {
      items {
        product {
          name
        }
        quantity
      }
      prices {
        grand_total {
          value
          currency
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

1. Query the cart again to verify the actual quantity.

<u>Expected results</u>:

Stock validation prevents invalid quantity updates.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The `updateCartItems` mutation returns *SUCCESS* response with a quantity of 100.
