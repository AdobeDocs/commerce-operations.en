## Issue

There is a redundancy of requests to reindex default source items when the inventory indexer is configured in async mode.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Configure [!DNL RabbitMQ]. 
1. Enable asynchronous reindex strategy by going to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** > **[!UICONTROL Inventory]** > **[!UICONTROL Inventory Indexer Setting]** and set **[!UICONTROL Stock/Source reindex strategy] = [!UICONTROL Asynchronous]**.
1. Create a custom inventory source.
1. Log into the [!DNL RabbitMQ] dashboard and go to the queues tab.
1. Check `inventory.indexer.sourceItem` queue and ensure it has zero messages.
1. Open a simple product from the backend and add *[!UICONTROL stock only]* to the custom source and save the product.
1. Load the `inventory.indexer.sourceItem` queue in the [!DNL RabbitMQ] dashboard and then check the messages.

<u>Expected results</u>:

There is only one message in the queue for the custom source.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Two messages are shown in the queue: one for the default source and the other for the custom source.
