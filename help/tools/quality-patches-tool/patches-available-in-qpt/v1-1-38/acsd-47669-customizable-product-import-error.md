## Issue

There is an internal server error when importing products with customizable options.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create an additional store view. Make sure you have 2 store views, e.g., en, UK.
1. Create two simple products, e.g., prod1 and prod2.
1. Prepare a csv file that adds custom options for both products in each store view and for the **All Store View** scope. Import this csv file.
1. Prepare another csv file that includes two records. The first record should be to update the custom options of 'prod1' specifically for the UK store view scope and the second record should be to update the custom options of 'prod2' for the **All Store View** scope. Import this second csv file.

<u>Expected results</u>:

You should be able to customize options without any error.

<u>Actual results</u>:

An integrity constraint violation error occurs.
