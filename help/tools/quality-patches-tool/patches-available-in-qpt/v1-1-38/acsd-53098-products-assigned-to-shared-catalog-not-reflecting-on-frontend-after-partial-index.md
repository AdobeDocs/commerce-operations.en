## Issue

Products assigned to a shared catalog via API do not show up on the frontend after the partial indexer executes the cron job, followed by the consumer cron.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Set up [!DNL RabbitMQ] as the queue service.
1. Switch indexers to **[!UICONTROL Update on Schedule]** mode.
1. Create a shared catalog and assign it to a company.
1. Create a simple product and assign it to a category. Execute the partial reindex:

    `bin/magento cron:run --group=index --bootstrap=standaloneProcessStarted=1`

1. Use the following API request to assign the created product to the shared catalog.

    ```
    pub/rest/all/V1/sharedCatalog/<id>/assignProducts
    {
        "products":[{
            "sku": "24-MB06"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

1. Execute the following cron to clear up the queues, and execute the partial reindex:

    `bin/magento cron:run --group=consumers` 
    
    `bin/magento cron:run --group=index --bootstrap=standaloneProcessStarted=1`

1. Log in to the frontend as the company's user.
1. Check the frontend category page.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The newly assigned products appear on the frontend.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The newly assigned products do not appear on the frontend.
