## Issue

When reindexing prices for a large product catalog, the performance of the queries executed during the indexing process gradually degrades.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a large simple catalog and assign custom options to these products (custom options use a temporary table during indexing).
1. Create at least 200 or more customer groups to increase visibility of the issue.
1. Create ten or more websites and assign all products to each of them.
1. Note that the imported products are almost identical, differing only by SKU and name.
1. Enable **[!UICONTROL DB Logging]**.
1. Execute the `bin/magento index:reindex catalog_product_price` command.
1. Check for *DELETE FROM `catalog_product_index_price_opt_agr_temp`* in the `db.log`.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The execution of the *DB queries* runs efficiently.
    
<u>Actual results</u>:

The performance of the *DB queries* on temporary tables become slow overtime, hence price indexing table takes a lot of time to complete.
