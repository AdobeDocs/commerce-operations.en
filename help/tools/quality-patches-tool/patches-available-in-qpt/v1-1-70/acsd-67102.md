## Issue

Issue where category loading takes a considerable amount of time or causes a timeout when a large number of categories and products are involved.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a new clean instance
1. Create 2500 categories and at least, 10000 products:
    1. Create a copy of setup/performance-toolkit and put it to ./var to be able to edit profiles
    1. Edit small.xml profile and set categories to 2500 and products to 250000
    1. Run bin/magento setup:performance:generate-fixtures var/setup/performance-toolkit/profiles/ce/small.xml
1. After creating products and categories, ensure all of them are anchors, run query:

```
UPDATE catalog_category_entity_int set value = 1 where attribute_id = (select attribute_id from eav_attribute where attribute_code = 'is_anchor');Â 
```

1. Go to admin menu, ensure we have a deeper structure of the categories, therefore move Category 2 deeper into Category 1 tree
1. Reindex

<u>Expected results</u>:

Every category opens from the first uncached try just in a few seconds.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Category opens in more than a minute.
