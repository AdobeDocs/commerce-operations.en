## Issue

Category loading is slow or times out when a large number of categories and products are involved.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a new clean instance.
1. Create Categories and Products:
    1. Copy `setup/performance-toolkit` to `./var` to make profiles editable.
    1. Edit `small.xml` profile and set categories to 2500 and products to 250000
    1. Run `bin/magento setup:performance:generate-fixtures var/setup/performance-toolkit/profiles/ce/small.xml`
1. Verify all categories are set as anchors by running the following query:

    ```
        UPDATE catalog_category_entity_int set value = 1 where attribute_id = (select attribute_id from eav_attribute where attribute_code = 'is_anchor');Â 
    ```

1. Go to Admin menu.
1. Confirm a deeper category structure exists.
1. Move Category 2 deeper into the Category 1 tree to reflect the intended hierarchy.
1. Reindex

<u>Expected results</u>:

Every category opens from the first uncached try just in a few seconds.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Category opens in more than a minute.
