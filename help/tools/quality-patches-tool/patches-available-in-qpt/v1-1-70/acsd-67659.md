## Issue

Issue where the translated exception message is used to map the error code for GraphQL Requests, causing unknown error codes for known errors.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Add file app/i18n/Magento/de_DE/de_DE.csv with translation of error string, like

```
"Could not find a cart with ID ""%masked_cart_id""","we have an UNDEFINED issue",module,Magento_QuoteGraphQl
```

2. Create new store view in the admin with code=test
3. Assign german language to the newly created store view
4. Perform setup:upgrade and setup:static-content:deploy -f
5. Perform a following GraphQL query with "Store: test" in headers

```
mutation {
    placeOrder(input: { cart_id: "test" }) {
        orderV2 {
            id
            number
        }
    }
}
```

<u>Expected results</u>:

Proper error code

```
{
    "errors": [
        {
            "message": "we have an UNDEFINED issue",
            "locations": [
                {
                    "line": 2,
                    "column": 2
                }
            ],
            "path": [
                "placeOrder"
            ],
            "extensions": {
                "category": "graphql-input",
                "error_code": "CART_NOT_FOUND"
            }
        }
    ],
    "data": {
        "placeOrder": null
    }
}
```

<u>Actual results</u>:

Error_code is UNDEFINED

```
{
    "errors": [
        {
            "message": "Oh noo, we have an UNDEFINED issue, see!",
            "locations": [
                {
                    "line": 2,
                    "column": 2
                }
            ],
            "path": [
                "placeOrder"
            ],
            "extensions": {
                "category": "graphql-input",
                "error_code": "UNDEFINED"
            }
        }
    ],
    "data": {
        "placeOrder": null
    }
