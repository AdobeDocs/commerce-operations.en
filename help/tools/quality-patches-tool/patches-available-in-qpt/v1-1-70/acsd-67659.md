## Issue

The translated exception message is used to map the error code for [!DNL GraphQL] requests, causing known errors to return an *UNDEFINED* error code instead of the correct one.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Add file `app/i18n/Magento/de_DE/de_DE.csv` with a translation for the error string, such as:
    
    ```
    "Could not find a cart with ID ""%masked_cart_id""","we have an
    UNDEFINED issue",module,Magento_QuoteGraphQl
    ```

2. In the Admin panel, go to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL All Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Create Store View]** to create a store view.
3. Set **[!UICONTROL Code]** to *test*.
4. Assign `german` language to the newly created store view.
5. Run `setup:upgrade` and `setup:static-content:deploy -f`. 
6. Run the following GraphQL query with header `Store:test`:

    ```
    mutation {
        placeOrder(input: { cart_id: "test" }) {
            orderV2 {
                id
                number
            }
        }
    }
    ```

<u>Expected results</u>:

The error response returns the proper error code:

```
{
    "errors": [
        {
            "message": "we have an UNDEFINED issue",
            "locations": [
                {
                    "line": 2,
                    "column": 2
                }
            ],
            "path": [
                "placeOrder"
            ],
            "extensions": {
                "category": "graphql-input",
                "error_code": "CART_NOT_FOUND"
            }
        }
    ],
    "data": {
        "placeOrder": null
    }
}
```

<u>Actual results</u>:

The `error_code` returned is *UNDEFINED*:

```
{
    "errors": [
        {
            "message": "Oh noo, we have an UNDEFINED issue, see!",
            "locations": [
                {
                    "line": 2,
                    "column": 2
                }
            ],
            "path": [
                "placeOrder"
            ],
            "extensions": {
                "category": "graphql-input",
                "error_code": "UNDEFINED"
            }
        }
    ],
    "data": {
        "placeOrder": null
    }
}
```
