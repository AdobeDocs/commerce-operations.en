## Issue

Issue where a GraphQL cart query returned an incorrect discount amount for virtual quotes.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. create products:
    1. virtual - 'virtual1' SKU
    1. virtual - 'virtual2' SKU
1. create cart price rule:
    1. that applies automatically without a coupon
    1. has actions:
    -> percent of product price discount - 20%
    -> 'Apply the rule only to cart items':
    -> SKU is virtual2
1. add products to a fresh, empty, quote through storefront:
    1. virtual1 SKU first
    1. virtual2 SKU second
1. Get the cart details using the following GraphQL query:

```
{
  cart(cart_id: "cart_id") {
    email
    itemsV2 {
      total_count
      items {
        uid
        prices {
          total_item_discount {
            value
          }
          price {
            value
          }
          discounts {
            label
            amount {
              value
            }
          }
        }
        product {
          name
          sku
        }
        quantity
      },
      page_info {
          page_size
          current_page
          total_pages
      }
    }
    applied_coupons {
      code
    }
    prices {
      discounts {
        amount {
          value
        }
        applied_to
        label
      }
      grand_total {
        value
      }
    }
  }
}
```

1. observe 'cart - items - prices - discounts'

<u>Expected results</u>:

virtual1 SKU has no discount listed in GraphQL
virtual2 SKU has discount listed in GraphQL

<u>Actual results</u>:

virtual1 and virtual2 SKUs have identical discounts listed
