## Issue

Datetime attributes in exported data don't include the time component. Additionally if  **[!UICONTROL Fields Enclosure]** is enabled, attribute values in the additional_attributes column will be enclosed within double-quotes.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

Create a product attribute with **[!UICONTROL Catalog Input Type for Store Owner]** = Date and Time.

1. Create a product attribute with **[!UICONTROL Catalog Input Type for Store Owner]** = Date and Time. 
1. Assign the attribute to the **[!UICONTROL Default]** attribute set.
1. Create a simple product with a date and time value for the new attribute.
1. Export the product to a CSV file from **[!UICONTROL System]** > Data Transfer > **[!UICONTROL Export]**.
1. Check the attribute value in the additional_attributes column. It only has the date part, but not time.
1. Update the attribute value to use the time, e.g. "11/26/22, 4:00â€¯PM".
1. Import the CSV file.
1. Check the catalog_product_entity_datetime table.

<u>Expected results</u>:

the date and time are exported and imported properly.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Only the date part is exported and imported.
