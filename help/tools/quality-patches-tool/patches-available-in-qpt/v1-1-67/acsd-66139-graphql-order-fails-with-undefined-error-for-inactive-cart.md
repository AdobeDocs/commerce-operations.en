## Issue

GraphQL returns an *UNDEFINED* error code instead of a specific one when placing an order for a non-existent or inactive cart, if the error message is translated.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Add `app/i18n/Magento/de_DE/de_DE.csv` and include the following error string translation:

```
"Could not find a cart with ID ""%masked_cart_id""","Oh noo, we have an UNDEFINED issue, see!",module,Magento_QuoteGraphQl
```

1. Create a store view in the Admin panel. Go to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL All Stores]**. ClickÂ **[!UICONTROL Create Store View]** and for **[!UICONTROL Code]**, enter the code `test`.
1. Assign `german` language to the newly created store view.
1. Run `setup:upgrade` and `setup:static-content:deploy -f`.
1. Run the following GraphQL query with header `Store:test`:

```
mutation {
    placeOrder(input: { cart_id: "test" }) {
        orderV2 {
            id
            number
        }
    }
}
```

<u>Expected results</u>:

Correct error response:

```
{
    "errors": [
        {
            "message": "Oh noo, we have an UNDEFINED issue, see!",
            "locations": [
                {
                    "line": 2,
                    "column": 2
                }
            ],
            "path": [
                "placeOrder"
            ],
            "extensions": {
                "category": "graphql-input",
                "error_code": "CART_NOT_FOUND"
            }
        }
    ],
    "data": {
        "placeOrder": null
    }
}
```

<u>Actual results</u>:

The `error_code` returned is *UNDEFINED*:

```
{
    "errors": [
        {
            "message": "Oh noo, we have an UNDEFINED issue, see!",
            "locations": [
                {
                    "line": 2,
                    "column": 2
                }
            ],
            "path": [
                "placeOrder"
            ],
            "extensions": {
                "category": "graphql-input",
                "error_code": "UNDEFINED"
            }
        }
    ],
    "data": {
        "placeOrder": null
    }
}
```
