## Issue

The `customerOrders` GraphQL query returns an internal server error when a product is deleted.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create products.
1. Create a customer and place an order with two products from the frontend.
1. Go to the backend and delete one product.
1. Create a customer token: 
   
```
https://localhost/pub/graphql
mutation {
  generateCustomerToken(email: "test@test.com", password: "123123qA") {
    token
  }
}
```

1. Retrieve the list of orders using the `eligible_for_return` filter (used in PWA to fetch customer orders):

```
https://localhost/pub/graphql
{
  customerOrders {
    items {
      order_number
      id
      created_at
      grand_total
      status
			items{
				eligible_for_return
			}
    }
  }
}
```

<u>Expected results</u>:

Order list is collected without errors.

<u>Actual results</u>:

Exception : "Internal server error"
