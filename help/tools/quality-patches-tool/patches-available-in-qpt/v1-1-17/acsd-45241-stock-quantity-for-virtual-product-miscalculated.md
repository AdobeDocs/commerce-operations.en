## Issue

Stock quantity for a virtual product is miscalculated after creating a credit memo.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a configurable product with a virtual product as a child product in the Commerce Admin.
1. Make sure both products created in step one are in stock.
1. Mark the quantity for the virtual product created in step one as 100 and keep the salable quantity 100 as well.
1. Add the product to the shopping cart.
1. Place an order with the virtual product created in step one.
1. Keep the order status as "Pending". No need to process the payment.
1. `order_created` record created in `inventory_reservation`. The virtual product quantity shows 100 with salable quantity as 99.
1. Open the order and go to **Invoice** > **Submit Invoice**.
1. `invoice_created` record created in `inventory_reservation`. The virtual product quantity is now 99, and the salable quantity is also 99.
1. Create a credit memo without selecting **Return to Stock**.

<u>Expected results</u>:

No new record is created in `inventory_reservation`, and the stock quantity for the virtual product is unchanged.

<u>Actual results</u>:

A `creditmemo_created` record is created in `inventory_reservation`, and the virtual product stock quantity is adjusted to 98 with salable quantity as 99.
