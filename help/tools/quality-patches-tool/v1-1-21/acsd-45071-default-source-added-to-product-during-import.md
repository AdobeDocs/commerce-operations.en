## Issue

After a product import, the default source is automatically assigned to the product, quantity is set to zero, and status is set to out of stock.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a new source.
1. Create a new stock using the new source.
1. On the product edit page in Adobe Commerce Admin, assign only the custom stock, set some quantity, and set stock status to **[!UICONTROL In Stock]**.
1. Import the product via **[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL System]** > **[!UICONTROL Data Transfer]** > **[!UICONTROL Import]**.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The default source is not automatically assigned to the product after importing.

<u>Actual results</u>:

The default source is assigned to the product after importing with out-of-stock status and zero quantity.
