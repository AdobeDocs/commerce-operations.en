## Issue

Users are not able to reapply the coupon once they have used it in a failed order.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Create a shopping cart rule with autogenerated coupons.
1. Add a product to the cart and apply the coupon.
1. Go to **Checkout**.
1. Make the added product "out of stock" before placing the order.
1. You should get an *out of stock* error.
1. Run cron.
1. Go to the cart and remove that product.
1. Add another product and apply the coupon.

<u>Expected results</u>:

The coupon code should apply successfully as the previous order was not placed.

<u>Actual results</u>:

You get a *coupon code is invalid* error.
