## Issue

An internal server error occurs while querying `configurable_product_option_uid` and `configurable_product_option_value_uid` fields from a B2B requisition list via GraphQL.

<u>Prerequisites</u>:

1. Adobe Commerce B2B modules are installed and enabled.
1. Requisition List is enabled in the configuration.

<u>Steps to reproduce</u>:

1. Log in as a customer on the storefront.
1. Add a configurable product to a requisition list.
1. Try to retrieve values for `configurable_product_option_uid` and `configurable_product_option_value_uid` fields using the `getRequisitionList` function in a GraphQL call.

```
query getRequisitionList {
  customer {
    requisition_lists(filter: { uids: { eq: "MQo=" } }) {
      items {
        items(pageSize: 1, currentPage: 1) {
          items {
            ... on ConfigurableRequisitionListItem {
              configurable_options {
                value_id
                id
                configurable_product_option_uid
                configurable_product_option_value_uid
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
