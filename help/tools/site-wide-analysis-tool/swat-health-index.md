# Understanding the SWAT Health Index

When you download the **[!DNL Recommendations Report]** from the SWAT Dashboard, the PDF includes a **[!DNL Site Wide Analysis Tool Health Index]** score in the **Introduction** section:

The SWAT Health Index helps you monitor and improve your Adobe Commerce site's overall health. This score is a guidance tool, not an absolute pass-or-fail measure.

## What is the Health Index?

The **[!DNL Site Wide Analysis Tool Health Index]** consolidates automated site checks into a single score from 0 (least healthy) to 1 (most healthy). The checks include:

- Security assessments
- Performance analysis
- Best practice evaluations
- Availability monitoring

Use the Health Index to:

- Quickly assess your site's general health
- Identify improvement area
- Track progress over time as you address issues

## Health Index limitations

Keep these important limitations in mind:

- **Not binding**: No contractual or support consequences are tied to your score
- **Not a compliance guarantee**: A high score does not indicate that your site is completely risk-free or compliant with all industry standards
- **May not reflect all changes**: Due to technical limitations, some fixes (patches, configurations) might not be detected immediately

## How to use your Health Index score

Use the Health Index as guidance for:

- **Continuous improvement**: Strive to improve your score, but don't interpret a lower score as failure.
- **Prioritize efforts**: Use specific SWAT recommendations to guide your technical work.
- **Document remediation**: If you've fixed an issue but the Health Index hasn't updated, document your actions and consult Adobe Support if needed.
- **Regular reviews**: Periodically check your Health Index to monitor trends and identify new issues.
- **Holistic view**: Combine the Health Index with other monitoring tools for a comprehensive understanding of your site's health.
- **Seek expert advice**: For complex issues, consult Adobe Support or a qualified developer.
- **Stay informed**: Keep up with Adobe Commerce updates and best practices to maintain a healthy site.
