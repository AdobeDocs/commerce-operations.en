# Install Guide

The [!DNL Site-Wide Analysis Tool] provides 24/7 real-time performance monitoring, reports, and recommendations to ensure the security and operability of Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure installations. It also provides detailed information about available and installed patches, third-party extensions, and your Adobe Commerce installation.

>[!INFO]
>
>Learn [how to enable](../site-wide-analysis-tool/access.md) the [!DNL Site-Wide Analysis Tool] and generate reports.

If you have an on-premises installation of Adobe Commerce, install an agent on your infrastructure to use the tool. You do not need to install the agent on Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure projects.

## Agent

The [!DNL Site-Wide Analysis Tool] Agent allows you to use the [!DNL Site-Wide Analysis Tool] for on-premises installations of Adobe Commerce.

The [!DNL Site-Wide Analysis Tool] Agent collects application and business data, analyzes it, and provides additional insights about the health of your installation so that you can improve customer experience. It monitors your application and helps you identify performance, security, availability, and application issues.

Installing the agent requires the following steps:

1. Verify system requirements.

1. Configure API keys in the [!UICONTROL Commerce Services Connector] extension.

1. Install the agent.

1. Run the agent.

>[!INFO] 
>
>The agent supports multi-node Adobe Commerce installations. Install and configure the agent on each node.

## System requirements

Your on-premises infrastructure must meet the following requirements before installing the agent:

- Operating systems

  - [!DNL Linux x86-64] distributions, such as [!DNL Red Hat&reg; Enterprise Linux (RHEL)], [!DNL CentOS], [!DNL Ubuntu], [!DNL Debian], and similar

  >[!IMPORTANT]
  >
  >Adobe Commerce is not supported on [!DNL Microsoft Windows] or [!DNL macOS].

- Adobe Commerce 2.4.1 or later

- [!DNL Commerce Services Connector extension]

- PHP CLI

- Bash/shell utilities

  - `php`
  
  - `wget`

  - `awk`

  - `nice`

  - `grep`

  - `openssl`

## [!DNL Commerce Services Connector]

The agent requires the [[!DNL Commerce Services Connector]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/user-guides/integration-services/saas.html) extension to be installed on your system and [configured](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/user-guides/integration-services/saas.html) with API keys. To verify that the extension is installed, run the following command:

```bash
bin/magento module:status Magento_ServicesId
```

If you have installed the extension and configured it using an existing API key for a different service, you **MUST regenerate the API key** and update it in the Adobe Commerce Admin for the agent.

1. Put your website into [maintenance mode](../../installation/tutorials/maintenance-mode.md).

1. Log into [account.magento.com](https://account.magento.com/customer/account/login?_ga=2.164207871.117144580.1649172612-1623400270.1640858671).

   > If you have trouble accessing your account, see [Unable to log in to Adobe Commerce support or cloud account](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-knowledge-base/kb/troubleshooting/miscellaneous/unable-to-log-in-to-support-or-cloud-project.html) for troubleshooting help.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL API Portal]**.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Delete]** next to the existing API Key.

1. [Configure](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/user-guides/integration-services/saas.html) a new API key.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> If you generate new keys in the API Portal, immediately update the API keys in the [!DNL Admin configuration]. If you generate new keys and do not update the keys in the [!DNL Admin], your SaaS extensions will no longer work and you will lose valuable data.

If the extension is not installed, use the following instructions to install it:

1. Add the extension to your `composer.json` file and install it.

   ```bash
   composer require magento/services-id
   ```

1. Enable the extension.

   ```bash
   bin/magento module:enable Magento_ServicesId
   ```

1. Update the database schema.

   ```bash
   bin/magento setup:upgrade
   ```
   
1. Clear the cache.

   ```bash
   bin/magento cache:clean
   ```
   
1. [Configure API Keys](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/user-guides/integration-services/saas.html) to connect the extension to your system.

   ```yaml
   project:
     appname: "Acme Inc" # Company or site name that you provided when installing the agent
   application:
     phppath: php # Path to your PHP CLI interpreter (usually /usr/bin/php)
     magentopath: /var/www/html/example.com # Root directory where your Adobe Commerce application is installed (usually /var/www/html)
     checkregistrypath: /path/to/swat-agent/tmp # Temporary directory for the agent (usually /usr/local/swat-agent/tmp)
     issandbox: false # Enabling sandbox mode to use the agent on staging environment (true or false)
     database:
       user: your-adobe-commerce-db-username # Database user for your Adobe Commerce installation
       password: your-password # Database password for the specified user for your Adobe Commerce installation
       host: 127.0.0.1 # Database host for your Adobe Commerce installation
       dbname: your-adobe-commerce-db-name # Database name for your Adobe Commerce installation
       port: 3306 # Database port for your Adobe Commerce installation (usually 3306)
       tableprefix: # Table Prefix for your Adobe Commerce installation (default value: empty)
    enableautoupgrade: true # Enables automatic upgrade (restart required after an upgrade; agent does not check for upgrades if the option is disabled; true or false)
    runchecksonstart: true # Collect data on the first run (Usually 1)
    loglevel: error # Determines what events are logged based on severity (usually error)
   ```

1. Verify the installation.

   ```bash  
   scheduler -v
   ```

   ```bash
   Version: 1.0.1
   Success exit.
   ```

1. After downloading and installing the agent, you must [configure it to run](#run-the-agent) using one of the following methods:

   - [Service](#service) (preferred if you have root access)
   
   - [Cron](#cron)

## Run the agent {#run-the-agent}

We recommend configuring the agent to run as a service. If you have limited access to your infrastructure and do not have root permissions, then you must use [cron](#cron) instead.

### Service {#service}

1. Create a systemd unit file `(/etc/systemd/system/scheduler.service)` with the following configuration (replace `<filesystemowner>` with the UNIX&reg; user that owns the directory where the agent and the Adobe Commerce software are installed). If you downloaded the agent as a root user, change the directory and nested files owner.

   ```config
   [Unit]
   Wants=network.target
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   User=<filesystemowner>
   ExecStart=/path/to/agent/scheduler
   Restart=always
   RestartSec=3

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

1. Launch the service.

   ```bash
   systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

   ```bash
   systemctl start scheduler
   ```

   ```bash
   systemctl enable scheduler
   ```

1. Validate that the service is up and running.

   ```bash
   journalctl -u scheduler | grep "Application is going to update" | tail -1 && echo "Agent is successfully installed"
   ```

### Cron {#cron}

If you do not have root permissions or do not have permissions to configure a service as root, you can use cron instead.

Update your cron schedule:

```bash
( crontab -l ; echo "* * * * * flock -n /tmp/swat-agent.lockfile -c '/path/to/agent/scheduler' >> /path/to/agent/errors.log 2>&1" ) | sort - | uniq - | crontab -
```

## Uninstall

Run the following commands to uninstall the service from your system and remove all generated files:

1. Stop the scheduler.

   ```bash
   systemctl stop scheduler
   ```

1. Disable the scheduler.

   ```bash
   systemctl disable scheduler
   ```

1. Remove the scheduler service's `systemd` unit file.

   ```bash
   rm /etc/systemd/system/scheduler.service
   ```

1. Reload the `systemd` manager configuration.

   ```bash
   systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

1. Reset any `systemd` units from a failed state.

   ```bash
   systemctl reset-failed
   ```

1. Remove the scheduler service directory.

   ```bash
   rm -rf <CHECK_REGISTRY_PATH> #see SWAT_AGENT_APPLICATION_CHECK_REGISTRY_PATH in /etc/systemd/system/scheduler.service
   ```

1. Remove the scheduler binary file.

   ```bash
   rm /usr/local/bin/scheduler
   ```

If you configured the agent to run with cron instead, use the following instructions:

1. Remove the agent from the crontab list.

   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

1. Stop the running job.

   ```bash
   ps aux | grep scheduler
   ```

1. Remove the directory where you installed the agent.

   ```bash
   rm -rf swat-agent
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Access keys not parsed properly

You may see the following error if your access keys are not parsed properly:

```terminal
ERRO[2022-10-10 00:01:41] Error while refreshing token: error while getting jwt from magento: invalid character 'M' looking for beginning of value
FATA[2022-12-10 20:38:44] bad http status from https://updater.supportinsights.adobe.com/linux-amd64.json: 403 Forbidden
```

To resolve this error, try the following steps:

1. Do a [scripted install](#scripted), save the output, and review the output for errors.
1. Review the generated `config.yaml` file and verify that the path to your Commerce instance and PHP is correct.
1. Make sure that the user that is running the scheduler is in the [file system owner](../../installation/prerequisites/file-system/overview.md) Unix group or is the same user as the file system owner.
1. Make sure that the [Commerce Services Connector](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/user-guides/integration-services/saas.html) keys are installed correctly and try updating them to connect the extension to your system.
1. [Uninstall](#uninstall) the agent after updating the keys and reinstall using the [install script](#scripted).
1. Run the scheduler and see if you still receive the same error.
1. If you still receive the same error, increase the log level in the `config.yaml` to debug and open a Support ticket.

### *SIGFAULT* Error

If you see a *SIGFAULT* error when running binary, you probably do not run this as the file owner of Adobe Commerce and Agent files. 
To resolve, please check if all the files inside the agent directory that have the same user as the fileowner that Adobe Commerce files have, and binary should be run under that user as well.
You can use the `chown` command to change the files owner and switch to the appropriate user. 
Make sure that your daemonization mechanism (Cron or System.d) runs the process under the appropriate user.
