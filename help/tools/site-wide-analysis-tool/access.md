# How to Access the [!DNL Site-Wide Analysis Tool]

There are two ways you can access the [!DNL Site-Wide Analysis Tool Dashboard].

You can access the [!DNL dashboard] from either the [[!DNL Site-Wide Analysis Tool] Website](https://supportinsights.adobe.com/commerce) directly **(for Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure only)** and log in with your Adobe ID, or access via the [!DNL dashboard] from your store's [!DNL Admin Panel].  

The [!DNL Site-Wide Analysis Tool] service is available in [production mode](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/magento/installation-modes.html) for [!DNL Admin] users with permission to access user [role resources](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/system/permissions-user-roles.html).

>[!NOTE]

>If you have an on-premises installation of Adobe Commerce, you must install an [agent](../site-wide-analysis-tool/installation.md) on your infrastructure to use the tool.
