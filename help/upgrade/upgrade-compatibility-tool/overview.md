# Overview of the [!DNL Upgrade Compatibility Tool]

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!DNL Upgrade Compatibility Tool] is available for Adobe Commerce instances only.

The [!DNL Upgrade Compatibility Tool] is a command-line tool that checks an Adobe Commerce customized instance against a specific version by analyzing all modules and core code installed in it. It returns a list of critical issues, errors, and warnings that must be addressed before upgrading to the latest version of Adobe Commerce. It also identifies potential problems that must be fixed in your code before attempting to upgrade to a newer version of Adobe Commerce.

The [!DNL Upgrade Compatibility Tool] allows you to identify when core code changes have been made to customized features. See the [Run the tool](../upgrade-compatibility-tool/run.md) topic for more information.

It is distributed as a Composer package with every release of an Adobe Commerce version. See the [Developer](../upgrade-compatibility-tool/developer.md) topic for more information.

Refer to the [Install](../upgrade-compatibility-tool/install.md) for the first steps with the [!DNL Upgrade Compatibility Tool].
