# Adobe Commerce access keys

{{commerce-only}}

You must have [Adobe Commerce access keys](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/marketplace/guides/sellers/profile-information/#access-keys) to download and use the [!DNL Upgrade Compatibility Tool]. Add your Adobe Commerce access keys to your `auth.json` file, which is located at `~/.composer` by default.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Check your **COMPOSER_HOME** environment variable to see where the `auth.json` file is located.

The **public key** corresponds to the _username_ whereas the **private key** is the _password_:

## Example of Adobe Commerce access keys

```json
    "http-basic": {
        "repo.magento.com": {
            "username": "YOUR_MAGENTO_PUBLIC_KEY",
            "password": "YOUR_MAGENTO_PRIVATE_KEY"
        }
    },
```

>[!NOTE]
>
> If you do not correctly configure your **Adobe Commerce access keys**, you cannot download the [!DNL Upgrade Compatibility Tool] and the `composer create-project` command will fail.

Run `composer install` in your terminal to install dependencies.
