# Review platform changes before upgrading

Adobe Commerce 2.4.4 will be generally available on March 8, 2022 and beta code is now available for partners to start preparing. The 2.4.4 release is unique because it includes many platform updates. It is powered by PHP 8.1 together with several key framework upgrades including:  

- Removing support for PHP 7.3
- Support for OpenSearch as an alternative to Elasticsearch
- Latest version support of multiple system dependencies, including Elasticsearch, Redis, MySQL, JavaScript libraries, and Composer dependencies
- Removal of older JavaScript libraries, redundant Laminas libraries, and NPM dependencies
