# Deliverables 

The discovery process identifies specific Adobe Commerce implementation deliverables. Review the following sections to learn more.

## Business requirements

This document captures business requirement approvals for functional specifications and the usability of the customer experience. It is used to drive the user experience, visual design, and detailed testing plans.

## System diagram

A systems diagram should show data (for example, orders, products, third-party integrations) flowing to and from the various systems involved (Adobe Commerce, OMS, ESP, payment providers).

## Technical specifications

This document defines the technical implementation approach and applicable details about all third-party integrations and systems that need to be modified. This can include APIs that don’t currently exist and need to be developed.

## Data mapping

A data mapping document covers categories, products, recommendations, pricing data, and inventory and includes the necessary attributes to map the current products and categories to your Adobe Commerce product catalog.

## Flow diagram

Shows the user flows for critical and/or unique processes, especially when customized from standard Adobe Commerce behavior.

## Scope and vendors

This is a finalized list of named third-party vendors to be integrated into the Adobe Commerce solution.

## Product data

A review of an organization’s existing products, pricing, and inventory data as well as a plan to map data attributes used to populate Adobe Commerce.

## Project plan

A project plan details the high-level tasks and timelines associated with the implementation initiative, including overlapping integrations and third-party dependencies. The plan may also include a responsibilities matrix, or [RACI](../planning/ownership.md), chart that shows who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed.
