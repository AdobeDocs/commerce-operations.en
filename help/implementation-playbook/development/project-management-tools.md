# Project management tools

Moving out of the actual Adobe Commerce environment, but equally important, are the tools and solutions that make collaboration and the entire development process as smooth as possible.

## SLA management

Jira Service Management empowers development and operations teams to collaborate at a high velocity so that they can respond to business changes and deliver great customer and employee service experiences fast.

## Document Management

Confluence is great tool to build, organize, and collaborate on work in one place from virtually anywhere. Confluence comes equipped with best-practice templates,so you donâ€™t need to reinvent the wheel. Get started easily and maintain consistency across teams and projects.

## Ticket Management

Jira is a ticket tracking and management system (including version and release management) with powerful features, such as:

- Constraint workflow to avoid mistakes
- Estimation and time-sheet tracking at ticket level
- Easy ticket visualization and moving with Agile/Scrum
- Transparent information among client team and development team

## Source Code Management

Bitbucket is more than just Git code management. Bitbucket gives teams one place to plan projects, collaborate on code, test, and deploy. Using Bitbucket, you can approve code reviews more efficiently with pull requests. You can also create a merged checklist with designated approvers and hold discussions right in the source code with inline comments.

GitHub is similar to Bitbucket, which is also used in some projects.

## Communication

For different clients, we may use a variety of tools for communication: email, Microsoft Teams, and Slack are all common tools that we have leveraged for project-related communications.

## Meeting

Microsoft Teams and Zoom are the most common tools to set up online meetings.

## Continuous Integration (CI)/ Continuous Delivery (CD)

Jenkins is the leading open-source automation solution and provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying, and automating any project. Jenkins can be used as a simple CI server or turned into the CD hub for any project.
