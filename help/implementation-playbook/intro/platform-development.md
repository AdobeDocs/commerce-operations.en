# Principles of platform development

This topic dives deeper into some of the main standards of Adobe Commerce development, including:

- Functional and technical scoping in line with the development process
- Development best practices aligning with the MVC architecture
- Architectural considerations, including GRA
- Security standards against scripting and exploits
- Extension development best practices
- Web API integrations with REST, SOAP, and GraphQL
- Performance improvements for coding and infrastructure
- Testing tools, strategies, and methodologies

While some solution implementers may have their own preferences in methodologies, processes, and tools, this playbook focuses on accepted best practices and methodologies that can be shared across most implementations.

Like any large IT project, Adobe Commerce is built on coding standards that use best practices and standardizations, and standards that have been established within the Adobe Commerce [Coding Standard](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/php/coding-standards/). Following these standards is important for eliminating bugs and improving the quality and maintainability of custom-built code.

## Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure

Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure is a managed, automated hosting platform for the Adobe Commerce software. Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure comes with various features that sets it apart from on-premises Adobe Commerce implementations.
