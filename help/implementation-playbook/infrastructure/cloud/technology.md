# Technologies

Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure uses several software solutions to support the platform. See the following topics in the _Cloud Guide_ for more details:

- [Pro environment architecture](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/architecture/pro-architecture.html#production-technology-stack)
- [Starter environment architecture](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/architecture/starter-architecture.html#production-and-staging-technology-stack)

## Features and benefits

- Three dedicated instances in a virtual private cloud (VPC) with an elastic load balancer across three separate availability zones or datacenters.
- Higher resiliency against events that may cause a single instance to fail. For example, an outage of an entire AWS availability zone or datacenter.
- Zero downtime scaling across the entire stack, including web, caching, search, and database.
