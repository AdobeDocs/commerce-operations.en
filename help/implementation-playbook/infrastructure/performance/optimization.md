# Performance optimization

Performance is a big topic. When users experience a slow or unresponsive site, it affects conversion. We recommend following these steps to optimize the performance of your Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure implementation:

- Assess the problem
- Measure performance
- Identify part of the system critical for performance improvement
- Modify part of system to remove the bottleneck
- Measure the performance after modification
- If better, adopt it or revert

## Typical Performance Issues

The impact of a slow experience is usually defined by two indicators, and each factor can be caused for tons of reasons.

High time-to-first-byte (TTFB) is usually regarded as an indicator that defines the serverâ€™s response speed. The time not only comes from source code execution for handling the request, but it can also be impacted by the following factors:

- DNS lookup
- Slow queries from DB layer
- CPU time from each application layer
- Memory limitation
- I/O wait may affect from file read and write, connect service via socket
- Software settings (nginx, PHP, MySQL, Redis, Varnish)
- Network bandwidth
- Bad caching
- Bad code
- Bad integration approach
- Dependency of slow third-party service response
- Architecture without scalability

Slow-loading resources are usually regarded as an indicator that defines the static resource (CSS, JavaScript, images, videos, third-party Ajax call response).

Adobe Commerce can scale with your business through its capabilities:

There are also key factors driving scale in commerce, which also impact the overall performance.

- Complex and large product catalog
- Large numbers of admins
- Global storefronts
- High-variable traffic
- Expanding touchpoints
- High-volume transactions

For layered and cacheable architectures built for scale, you can use this graph as a reference.
