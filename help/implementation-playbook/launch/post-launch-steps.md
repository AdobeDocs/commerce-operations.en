# Post-launch steps

Once the website is live, these activities would be performed as soon as possible to ensure the site was launched properly:

- Enable up-time monitoring tool (New Relic), activate checks, and monitor the site to ensure all services and access are in the green 
- Enable Adobe Commerce security scan periodically 
- Tag the cluster as live and create a support ticket to activate High SLA monitoring
- The CSE (Customer Success Engineer) and TAM (Technical Account Manager) perform the following tasks as soon as cutover is complete: 
  - Tag the cluster as High SLA for Adobe Commerce client and create a support ticket to activate it
  - Activate the Pingdom checks for domain names
  - Review monitoring state and ensure all items are in green
  - Keep the stakeholders informed of the warranty duration and parameters by email on go-live day
