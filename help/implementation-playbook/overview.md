# Implementation playbook

The purpose of this playbook is to provide the most holistic overview of a typical Adobe Commerce implementation.

From the early stages of project scoping through development, integrations, and deployment to ongoing support, there are many methodologies and best practices that you need to consider to successfully launch an Adobe Commerce project.

Additionally, these processes and considerations apply to any kind of Adobe Commerce project:

- Small, medium, or large implementations
- B2C, B2B, and B2B2C business models
- Monolithic or headless architectures
- Single-market or multi-market rollouts
- Extensive integrations with or without middleware

We hope that this playbook provides insights and guidance to a variety of stakeholders who would typically be involved in an ecommerce project initiative, including:

- CEOs and general management, who should have a solid idea of what an ecommerce rollout entails
- CMOs and digital managers, who will be working with business users on the platform itself
- CTOs and technical managers, who will be heavily involved during all stages of a technology project implementation
- Project managers and project champions who lead a commerce project initiative and should have all relevant information at hand

While the success of an IT project depends very much on the experience and expertise of the team (typically a solution partner) that develops, customizes, integrates, and maintains the code, we believe it is relevant for all stakeholders to familiarize themselves with the best practices of an Adobe Commerce implementation.
