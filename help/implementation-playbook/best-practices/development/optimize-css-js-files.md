# Optimize resource files

For a more responsive Commerce site, optimize CSS and JavaScript (JS) resource files and eliminate render-blocking resources.

- **Optimize CSS and JS files**—Reduce the time required to load CSS and JavaScript (JS) files by configuring Adobe Commerce to merge, minify, and bundle separate files into a single file.
- **Eliminate render-blocking resources**—Consider delivering critical JS and CSS features inline and deferring all non-critical JS/CSS styles. For guidance, see [Eliminate render-blocking resources](https://web.dev/render-blocking-resources/).

## Affected products and versions

[All supported versions, 2.3 and later](../../../release/versions.md) of:

- Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure
- Adobe Commerce on-premises
- Magento Open Source

## Merge or minify CSS files

The time it takes to load CSS and JavaScript (JS) files can be reduced by merging, minifying, and bundling separate files into a single file.

>[!IMPORTANT] 
>
>Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure always runs on Production mode and it is not possible to set it otherwise, therefore you must use the command-line method to enable merging, minifying, and bundling.

### Using Admin

To enable CSS merging or minification, go into the [!UICONTROL **Admin** > **Stores** > **Setting** > **Configuration** > **Advanced** > **Developer** > **CSS Settings**].

### Using the command line

To enable CSS merging in Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure:

1. Run this command locally:

   ```bash
   bin/magento config:set --lock-config dev/css/merge_css_files 1
   ```

1. Commit changes to the `app/etc/config.php` file and redeploy.

To enable CSS minification in Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure:

1. Run this command locally:

   ```bash
   bin/magento config:set --lock-config dev/css/minify_files 1
   ```

1. Commit changes to the `app/etc/config.php` file and redeploy.

## Minify JS files

### Using Admin

On the *Admin* sidebar, go to **Stores** > **Settings** > **Configuration** > **Advanced** > **Developer** > **JavaScript Settings**.

### Using the command line

To enable JS minification in Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure:

1. Run this command locally:

   ```bash
   bin/magento config:set --lock-config dev/js/minify_files 1
   ```

1. Commit changes to the `app/etc/config.php` file and redeploy.

## Merge and bundle JS files

You can turn on merging or bundling in the Commerce Admin (merging and bundling cannot be enabled at the same time): [!UICONTROL **Stores** > **Settings** > **Configuration** > **Advanced** > **Developer** > **JavaScript Settings**].

You can also enable Adobe Commerce built-in bundling (basic bundling) from the command line:

   ```bash
   php -f bin/magento config:set dev/js/enable_js_bundling 1
   ```
