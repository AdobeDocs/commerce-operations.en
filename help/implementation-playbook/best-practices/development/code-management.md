# Code management best practices for Adobe Commerce

This topic is designed to help you decide whether to use Git or Composer to distribute custom code, with consideration for release management, code complexity, and dependency management.

>[!NOTE]
>
>These best practices are most suitable for migrations and implementations; less so for single module development.

## Affected products and versions

[All supported versions](../../../release/versions.md) of:

- Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure
- Adobe Commerce on-premises

It covers both [global reference architecture (GRA)](../../architecture/global-reference/overview.md) and single instance installations.

## Solutions to avoid

1. **Combining Composer and `app/code` for your modules**

   Result in having all the disadvantages of both code management styles combined in your project. It adds unnecessary complexity, instability, and lack of flexibility.

   For example:
   - Explain both Git and Composer workflows (instead of only one of them) to the development team.
   - Install incompatible modules in `app/code` as there is nothing in place to stop that from happening.
   - Moving a module from `app/code` to Composer (or conversely) is cumbersome, especially with ongoing development.

1. **Satis Package Manager**

   Private Packagist costs ± &euro;600 per year. This cost is for the whole GRA combined, not per brand. Don't try to avoid these costs by using the free solution Satis. Satis does not automatically update your packages whenever you push commits to git. Also Satis has no built in authorization. You must maintain a web server to run Satis. You end up spending a multitude of the Private Packagist subscription fee maintaining Satis.

1. **Start with Git, then move to Composer**

   Make the choice for a code management approach at the start of your project. Switching from Git to Composer or conversely, with ongoing development is cumbersome and could lead to code loss and or revision history loss.
