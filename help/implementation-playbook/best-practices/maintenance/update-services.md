# Update services best practices

This article provides recommendations to keep your Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure technology stack updated and provides links to helpful resources. 

## Affected products and versions

Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure 2.4.x and later

## Update services

Upgrade the services and components used by Adobe Commerce before they reach or are close to the end of life date. This helps keep up with PCI compliance and decrease security vulnerabilities. 

Customers on Starter plans can self-serve on services upgrades. Refer to [Change service version](https://devdocs.magento.com/cloud/project/services.html#change-service-version) for details on how to do this.  

Customers on Pro plans can only self-serve on services upgrades in their [Integration environment](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-knowledge-base/kb/announcements/commerce-announcements/integration-environment-enhancement-request-pro-and-starter.html). For services upgrades on Production, you must [submit a support ticket](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-knowledge-base/kb/help-center-guide/magento-help-center-user-guide.html#submit-ticket) requesting the upgrade.

>[!WARNING]
>
>Service upgrades cannot be pushed to the production environment without 48 business hours' notice to our infrastructure team. This is required as we need to ensure that we have an infrastructure support engineer available to update your configuration within a desired timeframe with minimal downtime to your production environment.

You can view the list of service versions and end-of-life dates in the following file: [https://github.com/magento/ece-tools/blob/develop/config/eol.yaml](https://github.com/magento/ece-tools/blob/develop/config/eol.yaml).
