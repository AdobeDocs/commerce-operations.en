# Best practices for scheduling Admin updates on production sites

Schedule critical updates and operations on your Adobe Commerce sites during off-peak hours to prevent slow performance and outages on production sites.

Examples of critical actions:

- Admin configuration changes, for example updating a product attribute, or moving a product subcategory to another category
- Data import or export operations

Critical actions lead to cache invalidation and reindexing operations which significantly increase response time that can cause site outages.
