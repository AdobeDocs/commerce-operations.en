# Realpath cache size - Best Practice

<!--Add one or two sentences to summarize the overall contents of this best practice topic-->
It is recommended that you set realpath cache size to 10 MB for Adobe Commerce on-premises 2.3.x and Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure 2.3.x users. Realpath cache caches the real file system paths of filenames referenced instead of looking them up each time. Every time various file functions are performed or require a file and use a relative path, PHP has to look up where that file really exists.

## Affected products and versions

<!--Add details for the product and versions where the best practice info is relevant. Below are examples, adjust as needed. If info applies specifically to B2B or B2C, include that information -->

Adobe Commerce on-premises, all versions 2.3.x and above
Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure, all versions 2.3.x and above

<!-- Business type: B2C and B2B -- specify only if needed?)-->

## Best Practice

If realpath cache size is too low or high, it adds additional overhead during cache generation. Increase realpath_cache_size php setting in the php.ini file. Adobe Commerce best practice states that the allocated memory for realpath cache needs to be **10 MB**. Refer to [Configure PHP Options](https://devdocs.magento.com/cloud/project/project-conf-files_magento-app.html#customize-phpini-settings) in our developer documentation.
