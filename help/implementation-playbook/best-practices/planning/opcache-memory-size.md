# Best practice for OPcache memory size in Adobe Commerce

For Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure Pro plan architecture 2.3.x, it is recommended to set `opcache.memory_consumption` to at least 2 GB, to avoid performance degradation.

## Affected products and versions

* Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure Pro plan architecture 2.3.x
* PHP 7.0 and later

## Configure memory

Allocate at least **2GB** of memory for the [OPcache PHP module](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.opcache.php). The OPcache module is configured in the `php.ini` file. To allocate 2048 MB of memory, set `opcache.memory_consumption = 2048`.
