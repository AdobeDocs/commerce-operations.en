# Extensions best practices

Adobe Commerce third-party extensions (modules) have the potential to cause various issues that can negatively impact storefront performance. You can avoid these issues by following these best practices:

- Download and purchase third-party extensions from a trusted source, like the [Commerce Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/extensions.html).
- Update all third-party extensions to the latest version. 
- If you cannot keep your third-party extensions updated, consider using different extensions.
- When planning an upgrade to a new version of Adobe Commerce, verify that installed third-party extensions are compatible with the new version, and upgrade the extensions if required.

>[!NOTE]
>
> All extensions available in the Adobe Commerce Marketplace are required to maintain compatibility with new Commerce releases. See [Release compatibility](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/marketplace/guides/sellers/compatibility/releases/).
