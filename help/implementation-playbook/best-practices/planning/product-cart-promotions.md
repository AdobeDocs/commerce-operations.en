# Best practices for configuring promotions

For best performance, follow these best practices to configure sales and promotions for items in a shopping cart:

- **Sales rules (cart price rules)**–Configure no more than 1000 cart price rules for all websites
  - Manage and remove unused rules.
  - Add strict rule conditions (like attribute or category filter) for the most efficient matching.
- **Coupons**—
  - Verify that the total number of coupons in the database is less than 250,000.
  - Remove unused and expired coupons.
  - Generate only the number of coupons needed to meet campaign requirements.

## Affected products and versions

[All supported versions](../../../release/versions.md) of:

- Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure

- Increased time to render the cart page.
- Increased time to render the **Totals** block on the Checkout page.
- Applying coupons can take more than 2 seconds.
