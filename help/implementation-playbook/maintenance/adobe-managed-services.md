## Security

The Adobe security stack for Managed Services builds security in at every level using automation and consistency to reduce human error. Development and operations teams automatically inherit security controls from different levels of the stack.

Platform partners, such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, ensure maximum security coverage when applying platform customizations, while Adobe’s Managed Services team provides core security services, such as compliance, logging, authentication, scanning, and monitoring, and server security and secure application configuration.

The following diagram shows the Adobe Managed Services security technology stack:
