# Adobe Managed Services

Adobe Commerce is a platform for delivering ecommerce capabilities that includes robust out-of-the-box features, extensive customizability options, and third-party integrations.

Adobe Managed Services provides hosted and managed application and infrastructure for Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure Pro plans.

## Benefits

### Comparison of implementation options

Adobe Managed Services offers key benefits over on-premises and non-managed cloud implementations, including:

- **Enhanced service level targets (SLTs)**—Faster response times than standard Adobe Commerce support.
- **Enhanced service level agreements (SLAs)**—99.9% application level that regular Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure customers get on top of the 99.99% infrastructure level.
- **Designated Cloud Expertise**—Managed Services provides customers with a designated Customer Success Engineer (CSE) that serves as an application and cloud infrastructure expert. The CSE works with customers and their partners, providing them with best practices and guidance to accelerate time to market, including:
  - Guide and support through the onboarding process
  - Manage provisioning and platform setup
  - Advise on architectural principles for integrations and customizations
  - Drive incident management and businee continuity
  - Provide event support through planning, execution, and monitoring
  - Cloud support and expertise (proactive optimization, reporting, and best practices)

## Security

The Adobe security stack for Managed Services builds security in at every level using automation and consistency to reduce human error. Development and operations teams automatically inherit security controls from different levels of the stack.

Platform partners, such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, ensure maximum security coverage when applying platform customizations, while Adobe's Managed Services team provides core security services, such as compliance, logging, authentication, scanning, and monitoring, and server security and secure application configuration. See [Adobe Commerce Security](https://business.adobe.com/products/magento/secure-ecommerce.html) for more information.

The following diagram shows the Adobe Managed Services security technology stack:

![Diagram showing Adobe Managed Services security stack](../../assets/playbooks/managed-services-security-stack.svg)

## Upgrade assistance

The Managed Services team plays an active role in helping to plan and assist with the upgrade process. Your Customer Success Engineer (CSE) works with your upgrade project team, including project managers, and developers (internal subject matter experts, Adobe certified partners, or professionals from Adobe Consulting) to help your team ensure proper planning and adherence to best practices during the upgrade.

Managed Services CSEs have worked with Adobe Commerce customers to execute upgrades in large environments. Your CSE can help you leverage expert knowledge to maximize upgrade success while minimizing downtime and reducing overall risk. Additionally, Managed Services CSEs work with your dedicated staging environment for the upgrade so that existing production processes are not impacted while validating the upgrade.

Adobe provides a set of services around the provisioning, development, staging, and production of your Managed Services system. The following table provides an overview of the roles that each participant plays in the upgrade process:
