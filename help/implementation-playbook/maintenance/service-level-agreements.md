# Service level agreements (SLAs)

The service-level agreement (SLA) defines the level of service expected by a customer from the service provider, with simple metrics by which that service is measured, as well as the remedies or penalties, if any, should the agreed-upon service levels not be achieved.

The SLAs for different types of incident criticalities can be contracted, maintained, and measured. Further, the response type can have multiple standards (Gold, Platinum), based on the level of service required by the customer.

The following table describes a typical SLA metric breakdown with multiple service levels:
