## Cloud foundation

[Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/overview) provides an automated hosting platform with a self-service approach to building, deploying, monitoring, and managing your Commerce application in a cloud-native environment.

## Integrations and customizations

Traditional composable applications are built using point-to-point integrations between multiple services. This approach leads to a brittle integration layer with increasing technical debt. Adobe Commerce provides developers with comprehensive extension points and an extensibility platform to orchestrate API, events, and data resulting in a flexible composable architecture. The Adobe Commerce platform includes:

- Comprehensive [API](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/webapi/) coverage
- [Webhooks](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/extensibility/webhooks/) to customize native commerce processes
- [Admin UI](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/extensibility/admin-ui-sdk/) extensibility
- Over 700 [events](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-learn/tutorials/adobe-developer-app-builder/io-events/getting-started-io-events)

## SaaS features

Adobe offers a rich set of intelligent, composable services built to deliver personalized commerce experiences at scale to help you support your key business goals:
