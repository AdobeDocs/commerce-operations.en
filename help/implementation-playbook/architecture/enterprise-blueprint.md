# Adobe Commerce enterprise architecture blueprint

The goal is to take what we've learned working with large enterprise customers and scale our GTM efforts to show CIOs and technical evaluators how Commerce connects to all Experience Cloud solutions. 

The expected outcome is to convince customers and partners of the value of Adobe solutions and to adopt our new innovations to support their business goals.

## Cloud foundation

[Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/overview.html) provides an automated hosting platform with a self-service approach to building, deploying, monitoring, and managing your Commerce application in a cloud-native environment.

## Composability

Adobe Commerce is a composable ecommerce platform designed to launch ecommerce features faster, easily share data between third-party systems, and lower the cost of ownership for integrations and customizations.

Traditional composable applications are built using point-to-point integrations between multiple services. This approach leads to a brittle integration layer with increasing technical debt. Adobe Commerce provides developers with comprehensive extension points as well as an extensibility platform to orchestrate API, events, and data resulting in a flexible composable architecture. The Adobe Commerce platform includes:

- Comprehensive [API](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/webapi/) coverage
- [Webhooks](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/extensibility/webhooks/) to customize native commerce processes
- [Admin UI](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/extensibility/admin-ui-sdk/) extensibility
- Over 700 [events](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-learn/tutorials/adobe-developer-app-builder/io-events/getting-started-io-events.html)

## SaaS features

Adobe provides a collection of merchandising and data services to help you support key components of your business:

## Storefront technology
