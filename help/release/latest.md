## Simplified composable development with App Builder

Adobe Commerce is a composable ecommerce platform designed to launch ecommerce features faster, easily share data between third-party systems, and lower the cost of ownership for integrations and customizations.

Traditional composable applications are built using point-to-point integrations between multiple services. This approach leads to a brittle integration layer with increasing technical debt. Adobe Commerce provides developers with comprehensive extension points as well as an extensibility platform to orchestrate API, events, and data resulting in a flexible composable architecture. The Adobe Commerce platform includes:

- Comprehensive [API](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/webapi/) coverage
- [Webhooks](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/extensibility/webhooks/) to customize native commerce processes
- [Admin UI](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/extensibility/admin-ui-sdk/) extensibility
- Over 700 [events](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-learn/tutorials/adobe-developer-app-builder/io-events/getting-started-io-events.html)

![Comprehensive extensibility graphic](../assets/release/comprehensive-extensibility.png){align="center" zoomable="yes"}

[Adobe Developer App Builder](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-learn/tutorials/adobe-developer-app-builder/introduction-to-app-builder.html) for Adobe Commerce is a cloud-native extensibility platform to build custom capabilities and integrate with third-party solutions. It includes API orchestration with [API Mesh](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-learn/tutorials/adobe-developer-app-builder/api-mesh/getting-started-api-mesh.html), scalable event-based data routing using [Adobe I/O Events](https://developer.adobe.com/events/docs/), and a [serverless runtime](https://developer.adobe.com/runtime/docs/guides/overview/howitworks/).

This approach simplifies how developers add new services or replace existing services into their composable stack. With App Builder, developers can easily build apps and integrations while Adobe handles provisioning, scaling, and security of the App Builder infrastructure. Unified web consoles, developer tooling, logging, and monitoring provide a superior developer experience and make it simpler to build, run, and manage apps and integrations. Most importantly, you can plug in third-party services to App Builder to add powerful extensibility to your existing investments.

## Webhooks and AdminUI SDK enhancements

[!BADGE Available now]{type=Informative tooltip="Available now"}

With the latest release, Adobe continues to lead the way in simplifying composable development for ecommerce businesses. You can now [configure webhooks through the Admin UI](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/extensibility/webhooks/admin-configuration/) making it even simpler to extend native commerce processes like checkout, add to cart, and more. Webhooks can also now be triggered conditionally. For example, you can trigger a shipping calculation webhook for the checkout process only for specific ZIP codes.

Also, developers now have more granular control to extend the Admin UI, such as adding additional [columns](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/extensibility/admin-ui-sdk/extension-points/product/grid-columns/), [buttons](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/extensibility/admin-ui-sdk/extension-points/order/view-button/), and [mass actions](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/extensibility/admin-ui-sdk/extension-points/order/mass-action/) to existing Admin panels.

Later this year, Adobe will increase the availability of API Mesh to over 200 global locations, which reduces network latency and delivers improved compute time; providing a better overall experience for shoppers.

## Integration starter kit & pre-built ERP integrations

[!BADGE Available June 2024]{type=Informative tooltip="Available June 2024"}

Integrating an ecommerce platform with your ERP, OMS, or CRM is a mission critical requirement. Companies can spend tens of thousands of dollars building these integrations. To reduce the cost of integrating with back-office systems and to improve reliability of real-time connections, Adobe is introducing an integration starter kit.

The kit includes reference integrations for commonly used commerce data, including orders, products, and customers. It also includes onboarding scripts and a standardized architecture for developers to build on following best practices. The starter kit (currently in beta) is expected to reduce integration effort by up to 50%.

Later this year, Adobe will also be releasing pre-built integrations for two common ERPs using the integration starter kit:

- [Microsoft Dynamics Finance & Operations](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/products/finance)
- [SAP S/4HANA](https://www.sap.com/products/erp/s4hana.html)

These reference integrations can easily be customized by developers to meet the needs of the business, lowering the time to market and the cost of integrations.

## Edge Delivery Services in Adobe Commerce

[!BADGE Availabile now]{type=Informative tooltip="Available now"}

Research has shown that about [64% of shoppers](https://techreport.com/statistics/website-load-time-statistics-data) will head to a competitor's site to purchase a similar item if their web experience is poor. Conversely, for every 0.1 second improvement in site speed, businesses can expect a [9.2% increase in average order value](https://techreport.com/statistics/website-load-time-statistics-data).

In 2023, [Edge Delivery Services](https://business.adobe.com/products/experience-manager/sites/aem-sites.html) in Adobe Experience Manager was introduced to address these market trends by delivering faster, more engaging websites. Adobe is now bringing this robust technology to Adobe Commerce with a new high-performance storefront.

To offer a truly powerful and complete commerce experience, this new storefront, not only include the same benefits and capabilities delivered by [Edge Delivery Services](https://business.adobe.com/products/experience-manager/sites/aem-sites.html) with document-based authoring, a performance-first architecture, and out-of-the-box native experimentation; but also leverages the scale and performance of [Adobe Commerce SaaS](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/user-guides/home.html) products, and the flexibility and convenience of drop-in components that deliver the commerce capabilities needed to transact online.

This new high-performance storefront has already been successfully piloted by several Adobe Commerce merchants, such as [Maidenform](https://business.adobe.com/blog/perspectives/how-hanesbrands-and-adobe-built-one-of-the-fastest-ecommerce-websites-in-the-world), a property of HanesBrands. The results speak for themselves. Maidenform pages consistently deliver Google Lighthouse scores of 100 and [Core Web Vitals results](https://www.rumvision.com/tools/core-web-vitals-history/www.maidenform.com/?path=/) far above the industry average.

## Adobe Commerce's HIPAA-ready solution

[!BADGE Available now]{type=Informative tooltip="Available now"}

Consumers are becoming more comfortable purchasing healthcare products and services online. In fact, according to Insider Intelligence, retail ecommerce sales for health and personal care products will be the fastest growing ecommerce segment in 2024 growing at 17.5% to reach $153 billion in ecommerce sales in the US.

![A graph of health and personal care sales and prices](../assets/release/hipaa-sales-chart.png){align="center" zoomable="yes"}

When purchasing healthcare products and services, consumers expect their sensitive medical records and personal information to be highly protected. This is why Adobe Commerce has released a HIPPA-ready version of its cloud platform, enabling healthcare and life sciences organizations to offer consumers and patients better digital self-service capabilities. Adobe Commerce now joins the [Adobe Experience Cloud for Healthcare](https://business.adobe.com/solutions/industries/healthcare.html) suite of solutions, allowing customers to deliver secure and exceptional patient experiences while honoring consumer preferences.

## Deeper integration between Adobe Commerce and Adobe Experience Platform

[!BADGE Available June 2024]{type=Informative tooltip="Available June 2024"}

Last year, Adobe Commerce released [Data Connection](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/data-connection/overview.html), which  automatically collects, maps, and shares a range of Commerce data including storefront clicks and back-office order status and order history information. Today, digital commerce leaders are using Data Connection to break down data siloes, create unified customer profiles and audiences, personalize customer journeys, and power rich analytics.

In the first half of this year, Adobe will share even more data, including [Commerce customer profiles](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/customers/customer-accounts/manage/update-account.html), mobile app behavior, and custom attributes for back-office events to personalize campaigns and experiences at scale., mobile app behavior, and custom attributes for back-office events to personalize campaigns and experiences at scale. 

For example, customers will be able to use real-time customer registrations to trigger welcome email campaigns in [Adobe Journey Optimizer](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer/using/get-started/get-started.html).

![A diagram of connected data sources](../assets/release/data-connection.png){align="center" zoomable="yes"}

Informed by hundreds of implementations of Adobe Commerce alongside other Adobe Experience Cloud solutions, Adobe is launching [Use Case Playbooks](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/journey-optimizer/using/get-started/playbooks.html), which are ready-to-use implementation assets that allow customers to experience immediate time-to-value.  

The initial Adobe Commerce playbook (coming in the first half of 2024) enables customers to easily launch abandoned cart campaigns by guiding them through the data setup process. Once connected, customers can launch abandoned cart campaigns, saving them time and helping lift sales. One global retailer achieved 1.9x conversion-on-click, 1,000 more people re-engaged per week, and a double-digit revenue lift from launching abandonment campaigns with Adobe Commerce and Adobe Journey Optimizer. 

Adobe is also adding Commerce-specific dashboards in Adobe Experience Platform to help marketers analyze their Commerce data and identify opportunities for personalization.

![A diagram of an abandoned cart campaign](../assets/release/use-case-playbook.png){zoomable="yes"}

Last year, Adobe Commerce also launched [Audience Activation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/customers/audience-activation.html), which leverages unified customer profiles and audiences from Real-Time CDP to personalize shopper journeys. Specifically, [Adobe Real-Time CDP](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/rtcdp/intro/rtcdp-intro/get-started.html) combines Commerce data with other sources to build detailed customer profiles and audience segments for targeting content and promotional offers in Adobe Commerce. stitches Commerce data with other data from other sources to build detailed customer profiles and audience segments for targeting content and promotional offers in Adobe Commerce.

In the first half of the year, Adobe is expanding these [Audience Activation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/customers/audience-activation.html) capabilities to allow marketers and merchandisers to use Audiences defined in Adobe's Real-Time CDP in more places within the Adobe Commerce Admin, including [related products](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/marketing/promotions/product-relationships/product-related-rules.html), [promotions](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/marketing/promotions/cart-rules/price-rules-cart.html), and [content blocks](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/content-design/elements/dynamic-blocks/dynamic-blocks.html).

### Google Pay for Payment Services

[!BADGE Available 1H 2024]{type=Informative tooltip="Available 1H 2024"}

By the first half of this year, Adobe Commerce expects to release support for Google Pay, a leading digital wallet. According to Insider Intelligence, Google Pay is expected to reach [36 million consumers](https://forecasts-na1.emarketer.com/591373e4aeb8830e3829e400/5efc402eac4d4d07841472f9?_gl=1*qmtm8x*_ga*OTEwMjg4NjExLjE3MDY2MzQ2MTk.*_ga_XXYLHB9SXG*MTcwNjk3NjkzNS44LjAuMTcwNjk3NjkzNS42MC4wLjA.*_gcl_au*MTkwNzgzOTY5OS4xNzA2NjM0NjE5LjQ3MzE4MjY5LjE3MDY3MTcyMjUuMTcwNjcxNzIyNQ..) in 2024.

## AI-Powered personalization with Live Search

[!BADGE Available now]{type=Informative tooltip="Available now"}

Companies are seeking to personalize every part of the buying journey, from helping customers find the right products to delivering personalized campaigns, offers, and communications across all channels.

[Live Search, powered by Adobe Sensei](https://business.adobe.com/products/magento/live-search.html), helps you personalize how customers find exactly what they need so you can increase your conversion rates. In fact, Live Search customers boost conversion rates by an average of 7% after launching Live Search, with 15% of customers experiencing over a 40% conversion lift.

Adobe's latest release of Live Search focuses on making these features easy to use and empowers you to fully customize the search experience to fit your unique needs. You can now apply specific [AI re-ranking rules](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/live-search/live-search-admin/rules/rules-add.html) for your highest volume searches, then supplement those rules with a default fallback rule to cover the long tail of _all other queries_.

For example, a merchandiser can set a rule that any search query containing the phrase "dress" should be sorted by _trending items_ algorithm. That same merchandiser can then use the _most purchased_ algorithm for all other search queries. With this update, brands can showcase their top products for every search, simplifying personalized merchandising.

![A screenshot of a search engine](../assets/release/default-search-rule.png){align="center" zoomable="yes"}

Adobe has also introduced new customization options for Live Search. Using Live Search's [PLP Widget](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/live-search/live-search-storefront/plp-styling.html) and [Popover Widget](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/live-search/live-search-storefront/storefront-popover.html), you can design the Live Search UI features, including color swatches, product detail page layout options, add to cart buttons, price sliders, and more using low code configuration tools. Adobe provides full flexibility through an [open code repository](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/live-search/onboard/technical-overview.html?lang=en#widget-code-repository), which serves as a best-practice reference implementation.

## B2B commerce

[!BADGE Available April 2024]{type=Informative tooltip="Available April 2024"}

B2B ecommerce is another area of significant growth in online spending. In 2024, US B2B ecommerce sales are forecasted to reach [$2.048 trillion](https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/us-b2b-ecommerce-forecast-2022-2026)—growing at 10.3% year over year.

![A screenshot of a graph](../assets/release/b2b-sales.png){align="center" zoomable="yes"}

Adobe Commerce has delivered mission critical B2B ecommerce features for years, including company accounts, purchase approval rules, quote management, and customer price books. That's why B2B ecommerce leaders like [Watsco](https://business.adobe.com/content/dam/dx/us/en/resources/ebooks/building-better-experiences/building-better-experiences-and-bigger-profits.pdf), [SealedAir](https://business.adobe.com/customer-success-stories/sealed-air-case-study.html), [Sunbelt Rentals](https://business.adobe.com/customer-success-stories/sunbelt-rentals-case-study.html), [Transcat](https://business.adobe.com/customer-success-stories/transcat-case-study.html), [FoodServiceDirect.com](https://business.adobe.com/customer-success-stories/foodservicedirect-case-study.html), and [Univar Solutions](https://business.adobe.com/summit/2023/sessions/debunking-top-b2b-commerce-myths-s517.html) power their global B2B ecommerce channels on Adobe Commerce.  

Adobe is excited to share that new quoting and company management features will be available in April.

Company management features allow businesses to configure any buyer company structure they need to support B2B2X, conglomerates, or buying team structures using Adobe's new parent/child account structures.

## Subscription commerce powered by Zuora

[!BADGE Available now]{type=Informative tooltip="Available now"}

According to financial services firm UBS, the subscription economy is on track to reach $1.5 trillion, up from $650 billion in 2021. Consumers and businesses alike are becoming more comfortable purchasing subscription products and services due to their convenience and value.

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/3427363?learn=on)

To empower companies to add subscription revenue streams to their business and support existing recurring revenue business models, Adobe Commerce has partnered with Zuora — the industry leading subscription management platform — to launch the [Zuora Subscription Management for Adobe Commerce](https://commercemarketplace.adobe.com/zuora-revenue-management-with-subcriptions.html) extension.

Built on Adobe's App Builder framework, the [Zuora extension](https://commercemarketplace.adobe.com/zuora-revenue-management-with-subcriptions.html) received [Adobe Commerce App Assurance Program](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/marketplace/guides/sellers/assurance/) recognition for following simplified composable development best practices including a React-native front-end architecture and use of Adobe I/O events and Adobe API Mesh to limit customizations within the core Adobe Commerce platform.

## Adobe Experience Manager Assets Integration

[!BADGE Beta available by June 2024]{type=Informative tooltip="Beta available by June 2024"}

Leading with experience means presenting shoppers with high-quality product images and videos that compel them to buy. Adobe Commerce is making it easier to create and manage these critical resources by integrating with [Adobe Experience Manager Assets](https://business.adobe.com/products/experience-manager/assets/aem-assets.html). Instead of having to manually map and update assets between the products, which is time consuming and prone to errors, customers will be able to use a new Rules Engine Service that automatically matches and attaches images and videos in Adobe Experience Manager Assets to corresponding products in Adobe Commerce.

New or updated images added to Adobe Experience Manager Assets are automatically matched and shared, and users can leverage bulk matching capabilities to efficiently manage seasonal updates or new product line introductions.

A beta version of the New Rules Engine Service is expected to be released by June of this year. You can learn more about this integration with Adobe Experience Manager Assets integration in our [Adobe Commerce 2024 Roadmap Review](https://reg.adobe.com/flow/adobe/as24/sessions/page/catalog?tab.allsessions=1643149273691001NFtR&search=s432) breakout session at Adobe Summit.
