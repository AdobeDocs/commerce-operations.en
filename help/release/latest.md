## Edge Delivery Services for Adobe Commerce – (Limited Availability starting after Adobe Summit)

Research has shown that about 64% of shoppers will head to a competitor's site to purchase a similar item if their web experience is poor. Conversely, for every 0.1 second improvement in site speed, businesses can see a 9.2% increase in average order value.

This is why Adobe has invested heavily in Edge Delivery Services. Edge Delivery Services for Adobe Experience Manager was introduced in 2023 to deliver faster, more engaging websites. In 2024, we are bringing this robust technology to Adobe Commerce with a new high-performance storefront.

This new storefront will include the same revolutionary capabilities delivered by Edge Delivery Services in our industry-leading content management system (CMS) such as performance-first architecture, out-of-the-box native experimentation, and easy-to-use content creation via document-based authoring. With these new tools and technology, ecommerce businesses will be able to create content faster and benefit from unparalleled page load speed that can lead to increased conversion rates, improved search engine optimization (SEO) rankings, and better brand perception.

_"It's a dream come true to be as responsive to the business as we have been. We're saying, 'Hey, you wanted something faster? Well, we may possibly have the fastest ecommerce site in the world.'"_

Leo Griffin, Vice President, and Global Head of Consumer Technology, HanesBrands, Inc.

Edge Delivery Services has been piloted by several Adobe Commerce merchants already such as Maidenform, a property of HanesBrands. The results speak for themselves. Maidenform pages consistently deliver Google Lighthouse scores of 100 and Core Web Vitals results far above the industry average.

At Adobe Summit we will deliver an early access program for new Adobe Commerce users at. Adobe Commerce will also host a hands-on lab session to go more in-depth into the inner workings and configuration of this new storefront offering.

## Adobe Experience Manager Assets Integration – (Beta available by June 2024)

Leading with experience means presenting shoppers with high-quality product images and videos that compel them to buy. Adobe Commerce is making it easier to create and manage these critical resources by integrating with Adobe Experience Manager Assets. Instead of having to manually map and update assets between the products, which is time consuming and prone to errors, customers will be able to use a new Rules Engine Service that automatically matches and attaches images and videos in Adobe Experience Manager Assets to corresponding products in Adobe Commerce. New or updated images added to Adobe Experience Manager Assets are automatically matched and shared, and users can leverage bulk matching capabilities to efficiently manage seasonal updates or new product line introductions.

A beta version of the New Rules Engine Service is expected to be released by June of this year. You can learn more about this integration with Adobe Experience Manager Assets integration in our Adobe Commerce 2024 Roadmap Review breakout session at Adobe Summit.

## AI-Powered Personalization with Live Search (Available Now)

Companies are seeking to personalize every part of the buying journey, from helping customers find the right products to delivering personalized campaigns, offers, and communications across all channels.

Live Search, powered by Adobe Sensei, helps you personalize how customers find exactly what they need so you can increase your conversion rates.

Our latest release of Live Search focuses on making these features easy to use and empowers you to fully customize the search experience to fit your unique needs. You can now apply AI re-ranking rules to cover all queries, not just specific searches. This new default search rule allows you to set targeted rules for your most popular searches. For example, a merchandiser can set a rule that any search query containing the phrase "dress" should be sorted by trending items algorithm. That same merchandiser can then use the most purchased algorithm for all other search queries. With this update, brands can set one rule to cover the long-tail of less searched-for queries, simplifying personalized merchandising.

We've also introduced new customization options for Live Search. You can design the Live Search UI features including color swatches, product detail page layout options, add to cart buttons, price sliders, and more using low code configuration tools. We provide full flexibility through our open code repository which serves as a best-practice reference implementation.

## Deeper integration between Adobe Commerce and Adobe Experience Platform (Available by June 2024)

Adobe Commerce Data Connection automatically collects, maps, and shares a range of Commerce data from storefront clicks to back-office order status and order history data. In the first half of this year, we will share even more data, including Commerce customer profiles, mobile app behavior, and custom attributes for back-office events to personalize campaigns and experiences at scale. For example, customers will be able to use real-time customer registrations to trigger welcome email campaigns in Adobe Journey Optimizer.

Another way we are deepening our integrations to Adobe Experience Platform is a new Use Case Playbook. Use Case Playbooks are a library of ready-to-use implementation assets designed to help customers achieve faster time-to-value. The initial Adobe Commerce playbook — coming in the first half of 2024 — will enable customers to easily launch abandoned cart campaigns by guiding them through the data setup process. Once connected, customers can launch abandoned cart campaigns, saving them time and helping lift sales. We are also adding Commerce-specific dashboards in Adobe Experience Platform to help marketers analyze their Commerce data and identify opportunities for personalization.

Rich Commerce data can also personalize the Commerce experience itself. Adobe Real-Time CDP combines Commerce data with other sources to build detailed customer profiles and audience segments for targeting content and promotional offers in Adobe Commerce. In the first half of the year, we are expanding these Audience Activation capabilities to allow marketers and merchandisers the ability to use Audiences defined in Adobe's Real-Time CDP in more places within the Adobe Commerce admin including related products, promotions, and content blocks. Adobe Commerce will also release support for tracking of user behavior on native mobile app deployments of Adobe Commerce in addition to web channels.

## Protect patient data while growing ecommerce revenues with Adobe Commerce's HIPAA-ready solution (Available Now)

Consumers are becoming more comfortable purchasing healthcare products and services online. In fact, according to Insider Intelligence, retail ecommerce sales for health and personal care products will be the fastest growing ecommerce segment in 2024 growing at 17.5% to reach $153 billion in ecommerce sales in the US.

![A graph of sales and prices]()

When purchasing healthcare products and services, consumers expect their sensitive medical records and personal information to be highly protected. This is why Adobe Commerce has released a HIPPA-ready version of its cloud offering for healthcare and life sciences industries. Adobe Commerce now joins the Adobe Experience Cloud for Healthcare suite of solutions, allowing customers to deliver secure and exceptional patient experiences while honoring consumer preferences.

## Headless support for Adobe Payments (Available Now)

Over the past several years, Adobe has built a fully integrated payment services solution within Adobe Commerce. This solution allows merchants to securely manage payments and order data from one solution. In our latest release merchants can accept and process payments on headless storefront implementations such as Adobe Experience Manager and other custom front ends.

## Google Pay for Adobe Payments – (Available by June 2024)

By July of this year, Adobe Commerce expects to release support for Google Pay, a leading digital wallet. According to Insider Intelligence, Google Pay is expected to reach 36 million consumers in 2024.The addition of Google Pay rounds out support for popular digital wallets including Apple Pay and PayPal.

## B2B commerce – (Available April 2024) 

B2B ecommerce is another area of significant growth in online spending. In 2024, US B2B ecommerce sales are forecasted to reach $2.048 trillion dollars — growing at 10.3% year over year.

![A screenshot of a graph]()

Adobe Commerce has delivered mission critical B2B ecommerce features for years including company accounts, purchase approval rules, quote management, and customer price books. That's why B2B ecommerce leaders like Watsco, SealedAir, Sunbelt Rentals, Transcat, FoodServiceDirect.com, and Univar Solutions power their global B2B ecommerce channels on Adobe Commerce. We're excited to share that in April, we will deliver new quoting and company management features.

Company management features will allow businesses to configure any buyer company structure they need to support B2B2X, conglomerates, or buying team structures using Adobe's new parent/child account structures.

Building on our strong built-in quoting tool, B2B sellers can capture more revenue faster with new request for quote (RFQ) tools including draft quotes, duplicate quotes, split quotes, quote templates, and multi-admin access to quotes.

Both capabilities will be compatible with Adobe Commerce's native storefront architecture and headless commerce deployments via GraphQL APIs.

## Simplified composable development with App Builder

Being experience-led means focusing your digital and technology investments on delivering the best shopping experience for consumers and business customers. It doesn't mean you can overlook technology, however. It means instead of being technology-driven in your decision making, you need to reduce technical debt and complexity, so the best shopping experiences are easier to create.

Adobe Commerce is a composable ecommerce platform designed to launch ecommerce features faster, easily share data between 3rd party systems, and lower the cost of ownership for integrations and customizations.

Introduced in January 2023, Adobe Developer App Builder transformed how companies implement Adobe Commerce. App Builder for Adobe Commerce delivers core capabilities across the entire development stack including headless commerce using API Mesh, event-based data routing between Adobe Commerce and external systems using Events, extension (rather than customization) of Adobe Commerce using Webhooks, and extension of Adobe Commerce admin via Admin UI SDK. All these capabilities are delivered in a serverless computing environment so developers can easily build apps and integrations while Adobe handles provisioning, scaling, and security of the App Builder infrastructure.

## App Builder: Webhooks and AdminUI SDK enhancements (Available Now)

With our latest release we continue to lead the way in simplifying composable development for ecommerce businesses. Webhooks can now be configured through the UI with the ability to configure headers and endpoints to integrate 3rd party services into Adobe Commerce processes. Webhooks can also now be triggered conditionally. For example, you can extend the checkout process with a webhook only for specific zip codes. Also, developers now have more control to extend the Admin UI including adding additional columns to existing admin screens.

Later this year we will increase the availability of API Mesh to over 200 global locations reducing network latency, delivering improved compute time, providing a better overall experience for shoppers.

## App Builder: Integration Starter Kit & Pre-Built ERP Integrations to Microsoft & SAP S/4HANA (Available June 2024)

Integrating an ecommerce platform with your ERP, OMS, or CRM is a mission critical requirement. Companies can spend tens of thousands of dollars building these integrations. To reduce the cost of integrating with Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solutions and to improve reliability of real-time connections Adobe is introducing an integration starter kit for back-office integrations using Adobe Developer App Builder. The kit includes reference integrations for commonly used commerce data like orders, products, and customers. It also includes onboarding scripts and a standardized architecture for developers to build on following best practices. The starter kit is expected to reduce integration effort by up to 50%.

Adobe Commerce has been integrated with most ERP and CRM solutions in the market. Later this year, we will also be releasing pre-built integrations to two common ERPs, Microsoft Dynamics Finance & Operations and SAP S/4HANA using the integration starter kit. These integrations with focus on synchronizing 5 commonly used objects including Product, Customer, Stock, Order, and Shipment. These reference integrations can easily be customized by developers to meet the needs of the business, lowering the time to market and the cost of integrations.

## App Builder: Subscription commerce powered by Zuora (Available Now)

According to financial services firm UBS, the subscription economy is on track to reach $1.5 trillion, up from $650 billion in 2021. Consumers and businesses alike are becoming more comfortable purchasing subscription products and services due to their convenience and value.

To empower companies to add subscription revenue streams to their business and support existing recurring revenue business models, Adobe Commerce has partnered with Zuora — the industry leading subscription management platform — to launch the Zuora Subscription Management for Adobe Commerce extension.

Developed by IBM iX, the Zuora integration allows ecommerce businesses to:

- Launch subscription ecommerce on Adobe Commerce storefronts including native Luma theme storefronts and headless commerce implementations.
- Build subscription products directly within Adobe Commerce and sync product data to Zuora automatically.
- Price and package subscription products and services with over 50 pricing models, including recurring charges, one-time fees, and usage-based charges.
- Centralize complex billing operations and reduce manual processes. Use one billing system to unify provisioning data and consolidate invoices for subscriptions, physical goods, and other one-time purchases.
- Give customers the option to manage their subscription directly within the Adobe Commerce MyAccount experience.

Built on Adobe's App Builder framework, the Zuora extension received Adobe Commerce App Assurance Program recognition for following simplified composable development best practices including a React-native front-end architecture and use of Adobe I/O events and Adobe API Mesh to limit customizations within the core Adobe Commerce platform.

## 2.4.7 Beta performance enhancements (Beta Now)

Creating the most effective commerce experience is not only about merchandising, personalization, and fast storefronts. It's also reliant on the core platform that handles your product catalog, promotions, order processing, inventory availability, and more.

An ecommerce platform's core system is put to the test during the holiday season. For years, Adobe Commerce has delivered excellent holiday ecommerce performance for our customers. 2023 was no different. Between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, Adobe Commerce merchants captured $823 billion dollars in revenue in just 5 days. On Black Friday alone Adobe Commerce customers processed over 11 million orders.

Our commitment to performance continues with our upcoming release of our core platform in April. This new core release will support several key performance improvements including support for 100,000 active promotions, 10 million active coupons, the ability for multiple promotions to be redeemed against a single order, and caching of our GraphQL API responses. Adobe Commerce has released a beta version of our upcoming core platform update for developers to build and test against.

## Looking forward

As we move further into 2023, it is critical for ecommerce leaders to deliver experience-led commerce by improving storefront performance and using AI-powered personalization capabilities. Technology professionals must also move quickly using simplified, composable development frameworks. The entire team at Adobe Commerce is passionate about seeing ecommerce businesses thrive on our platform and our latest release highlights the expansive coverage of our platform.
