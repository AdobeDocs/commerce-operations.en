>Support for Adobe Commerce versions also includes support for [available security patches](versions.md).

## Adobe Authored Extensions

These Adobe Commerce extensions are decoupled from the core Adobe Commerce codebase. This allows Adobe to release iterations of these extensions on a more flexible timeframe and provide customers earlier access to new features.

The following table shows the version support for each extension relative to the Adobe Commerce version.
