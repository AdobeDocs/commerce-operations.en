# Supported Versions

The following table describes the status of Adobe Commerce software availability and where to get it, particularly for software that is available outside the conventional Adobe Commerce Composer package.

Services and extensions are tested on the latest released version of Commerce at the time of the products' release.

Supported versions have been fully tested by Adobe. Supported versions are available for assistance through Customer Support. Older versions may work properly but are not officially supported.

## Adobe Authored Extensions

These Adobe Commerce modules have been decoupled from the core Adobe Commerce codebase. This allows Adobe to release iterations of these modules faster to merchants who are willing to accept a little risk in exchange for earlier access to new features.
