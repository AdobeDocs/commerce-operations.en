# Product Availability

The following table describes the status of Adobe Commerce software availability and where to get it, particularly for software that is available outside the conventional Adobe Commerce Composer package.

Services and extensions are tested on the latest released version of Commerce at the time of the products' release.

Supported versions have been fully tested by Adobe. Assistance for supported versions is available from Adobe Customer Support. Older versions may work properly but are not officially supported.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Support for Adobe Commerce versions also includes support for [available security patches](versions.md).

## Adobe Authored Extensions

These Adobe Commerce extensions are decoupled from the core Adobe Commerce codebase. This allows Adobe to release iterations of these extensions on a more flexible timeframe and provide customers earlier access to new features.


The following table shows the version support for each extension relative to the Adobe Commerce version.
