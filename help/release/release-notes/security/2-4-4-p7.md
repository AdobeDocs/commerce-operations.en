## What's in this release?

Security enhancements for this release improve compliance with the latest security best practices. This patch includes five security fixes. See [Adobe Security Bulletin](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/magento/apsb24-03.html) for the latest discussion of these fixed issues.

## Security highlights

This release introduces two significant security enhancements:

* **Changes to the behavior of non-generated cache keys**:

  * Non-generated cache keys for blocks now include prefixes that differ from prefixes for keys that are generated automatically. (Non-generated cache keys are keys that are set through template directive syntax or the `setCacheKey` or `setData` methods.) 
  * Non-generated cache keys for blocks now must contain only letters, digits, hyphens (-), and underscore characters (_).  <!-- AC-9831 -->

* **Limitations on the number of auto-generated coupon codes**. Commerce now limits the number of coupon codes that are automatically generated. The default maximum is 250,000. Merchants can use the new **[!UICONTROL Code Quantity Limit]** configuration option (**[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Settings:Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL Customers]** > **[!UICONTROL Promotions]**) to control this new limit. <!-- AC-8753 -->
