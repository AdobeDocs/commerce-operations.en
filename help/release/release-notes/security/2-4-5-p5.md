### Security highlight

This release introduces a new full page cache configuration setting that helps to mitigate the risks associated with the `{BASE-URL}/page_cache/block/esi HTTP` endpoint.

The new **[!UICONTROL Handles Param]** configuration setting sets the value of this endpoint's `handles` parameter, which determines the maximum allowed number of handles per API. The default value of this property is 100. Merchants can change this value from the Admin ( **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Settings:Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL System]** > **[!UICONTROL Full Page Cache]** > **[!UICONTROL Handles Param]**. <!-- AC-9113 -->
