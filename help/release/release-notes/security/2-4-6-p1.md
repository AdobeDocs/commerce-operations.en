## What's in this release?

Security enhancements for this release improve compliance with the latest security best practices.  These improvements include 13 security fixes and platform upgrades. 

This security patch includes:

*  security fixes
*  security highlights
*  platform upgrades

### Security fixes

This patch includes 13 security fixes. See [Adobe Security Bulletin](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/magento/apsb23-35.html) for the latest discussion of these fixed issues.

#### Security highlight

The default behavior of the [`isEmailAvailable`](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/webapi/graphql/schema/customer/queries/is-email-available/) GraphQL query and ([`V1/customers/isEmailAvailable`](https://adobe-commerce.redoc.ly/2.4.6-admin/tag/customersisEmailAvailable/#operation/PostV1CustomersIsEmailAvailable)) REST endpoint has changed. By default, the API now always returns `true`. Merchants can enable the original behavior, which is to return `true` if the email does not exist in the database and `false` if it exists. <!-- AC-6695 -->

### Platform upgrades

Platform upgrades for this release improve compliance with the latest security best practices. 

*  **Varnish cache 7.3 support**. This release is compatible with the latest version of Varnish Cache 7.3. Compatibility remains with the 6.0.x and 7.2.x versions, but we recommended using Adobe Commerce 2.4.6-p1 only with Varnish Cache version 7.3 or version 6.0 LTS.

*  **RabbitMQ 3.11 support**. This release is compatible with the latest version of RabbitMQ 3.11. Compatibility remains with RabbitMQ 3.9, which is supported through August 2023, but we recommended using Adobe Commerce 2.4.6-p1 only with RabbitMQ 3.11.

*  **JavaScript libraries**. Outdated JavaScript libraries have been upgraded to the latest minor or patch versions, including `moment.js` library (v2.29.4), `jQuery UI` library (v1.13.2), and `jQuery` validation plugin library (v1.19.5).

## Known issue

The `nginx.sample` file was inadvertently updated with a change that modifies the value of `fastcgi_pass` from `fastcgi_backend` to `php-fpm:9000`. This change can be safely reverted or ignored. <!-- AC-8992 -->
