## Known issues

**Issue**: Web API and integration tests display this error when run on the 2.4.4-p1 package: `[2022-06-14T16:58:23.694Z] PHP Fatal error:  Declaration of Magento\TestFramework\ErrorLog\Logger::addRecord(int $level, string $message, array $context = []): bool must be compatible with Monolog\Logger::addRecord(int $level, string $message, array $context = [], ?Monolog\DateTimeImmutable $datetime = null): bool in /var/www/html/dev/tests/integration/framework/Magento/TestFramework/ErrorLog/Logger.php on line 69`. **Workaround**: Install the previous version of Monolog by running the `require monolog/monolog:2.6.0`Â command. <!-- AC-3651-->

**Issue**: Merchants may notice package version downgrade notices during upgrade from Adobe Commerce 2.4.4 to Adobe Commerce 2.4.4-p1. These messages can be ignored. The discrepancy in package versions results from anomalies during package generation. No product functionality has been affected. See the [Packages downgraded after upgrading from 2.4.4 to 2.4.4-p1](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/8214752983949)  Knowledge Base article for a discussion of affected scenarios and workarounds.
