## 2.4.4-p7

The Adobe Commerce 2.4.4-p7 security release provides security bug fixes for vulnerabilities that have been identified in previous releases. This release also includes security enhancements that improve compliance with the latest security best practices.

For the latest information about the security bug fixes, see [Adobe Security Bulletin APSB24-03](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/magento/apsb24-03.html).

### Security highlights

This release introduces two significant security enhancements:

* **Changes to the behavior of non-generated cache keys**:

  * Non-generated cache keys for blocks now include prefixes that differ from prefixes for keys that are generated automatically. (Non-generated cache keys are keys that are set through template directive syntax or the `setCacheKey` or `setData` methods.)
  * Non-generated cache keys for blocks now must contain only letters, digits, hyphens (-), and underscore characters (_). <!-- AC-9831 -->

* **Limitations on the number of auto-generated coupon codes**. Commerce now limits the number of coupon codes that are automatically generated. The default maximum is 250,000. Merchants can use the new **[!UICONTROL Code Quantity Limit]** configuration option (**[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Settings:Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL Customers]** > **[!UICONTROL Promotions]**) to control this new limit. <!-- AC-8753 -->

## 2.4.4-p6

The Adobe Commerce 2.4.4-p6 security release provides security bug fixes for vulnerabilities that have been identified in previous releases. This release also includes security enhancements that improve compliance with the latest security best practices.

For the latest information about the security bug fixes, see [Adobe Security Bulletin APSB23-50](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/magento/apsb23-50.html).

This release also includes security enhancements that improve compliance with the latest security best practices.

### Security highlight

This release introduces a new full page cache configuration setting that helps to mitigate the risks associated with the `{BASE-URL}/page_cache/block/esi HTTP` endpoint. This endpoint supports unrestricted, dynamically loaded content fragments from Commerce layout handles and block structures. The new **[!UICONTROL Handles Param]** configuration setting sets the value of this endpoint's `handles` parameter, which determines the maximum allowed number of handles per API. The default value of this property is 100. Merchants can change this value from the Admin (**[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Settings: Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL System]** > **[!UICONTROL Full Page Cache]** > **[!UICONTROL Handles Param]**). <!-- AC-9113 -->

### Known issue

**Issue**: Adobe Commerce displays a **wrong checksum** error during download by Composer from `repo.magento.com`, and package download is interrupted. This issue can occur during download of release packages that were made available during prerelease and is caused by a repackaging of the `magento/module-page-cache` package.

**Workaround**: Merchants who see this error during download can take these steps:

1) Delete the `/vendor` directory inside the project, if one exists. 
2) Run the `bin/magento composer update magento/module-page-cache` command. This command updates only the `page cache` package.

If the checksum problem persists, remove the `composer.lock` file before re-running the `bin/magento composer update` command to update every package.

## 2.4.4-p5

The Adobe Commerce 2.4.4-p5 security release provides security bug fixes for vulnerabilities that have been identified in previous releases.

For the latest information about the security bug fixes, see [Adobe Security Bulletin APSB23-42](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/magento/apsb23-42.html).

### Known issues

**Issue**: Web API and integration tests display this error when run on the 2.4.4-p1 package: `[2022-06-14T16:58:23.694Z] PHP Fatal error:  Declaration of Magento\TestFramework\ErrorLog\Logger::addRecord(int $level, string $message, array $context = []): bool must be compatible with Monolog\Logger::addRecord(int $level, string $message, array $context = [], ?Monolog\DateTimeImmutable $datetime = null): bool in /var/www/html/dev/tests/integration/framework/Magento/TestFramework/ErrorLog/Logger.php on line 69`. **Workaround**: Install the previous version of Monolog by running the `require monolog/monolog:2.6.0` command. <!-- AC-3651-->

**Issue**: Merchants may notice package version downgrade notices during an upgrade from Adobe Commerce 2.4.4 to Adobe Commerce 2.4.4-p1. These messages can be ignored.
