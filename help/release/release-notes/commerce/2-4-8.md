            <ul>
              <li><!-- BUNDLE-3373 -->To offer a true express payment experience, the Braintree extension now includes the shipping methods within the PayPal modal allowing the customer to checkout with fewer clicks. The shipping options are listed and calculated based on the shipping address saved in the customer's PayPal account. Previously, customers would land on a review page and choose a shipping method to complete payment. The review page is now optional allowing merchants to enable/disable this user journey. The PayPal Express buttons can be found on the PDP, mini-cart, cart and top of the checkout.</li>
              <li><!-- BUNDLE-3407 -->There is now a new version of the Braintree SDK. The PHP SDK version is 6.21.0. The JavaScript SDK version is 3.112.0. The latest version has some required changes for future compatibility with new features and functionality.</li>
              <li><!-- BUNDLE-3406 -->General code optimization within the Braintree extension.</li>
              <li><!-- BUNDLE-3405 -->To determine the page where a customer initiates the PayPal checkout experience (PDP, cart, or checkout), the Braintree extension now passes a <code>data-page-type</code> attribute to the JavaScript SDK. This attribute is used to render the button on the page.</li>
              <li><!-- BUNDLE-3404 -->Following the new PayPal brand guidelines, the Braintree extension now positions the PayLater messaging on the PDP, mini-cart, and cart. The messaging now sits closer/alongside the price/totals. The extension now also displays the PayLater messaging as part of the checkout button, rather than separately.</li>
              <li><!-- BUNDLE-3403 -->To enhance the express payment experience, the Braintree extension integrates shipping methods directly into the Google Pay modal, enabling customers to complete their checkout with fewer clicks. Shipping options are automatically displayed and calculated based on the address saved in the customer's Google Pay account. Previously, customers would be redirected to a review page to select a shipping method before completing their payment. Now, the review page is optional, giving the merchant flexibility to enable/disable this step in the checkout process. The Google Pay Express buttons are located on the mini-cart, cart and top of the checkout.</li>
              <li><!-- BUNDLE-3402 -->Updated the current Apple Pay mark to the latest version.</li>
              <li><!-- BUNDLE-3401 -->Updated the current Google Pay mark to the latest version.</li>

Providing tracking information and item-level details greatly improves the customer experience while reducing operational costs for merchants. Customers can easily log into their PayPal account, view the order, and access the tracking link. Merchants benefit from automatic resolution of "Item Not Received" PayPal disputes, quicker access to funds in payment and dispute holds, live tracking updates, item-level disputes (rather than disputes for the entire order), and enhanced merchant risk profiles.</td>
