# Release schedule

Adobe continually strives to find the right balance between making product upgrades simple and predictable while delivering improvements and new features to early adopters faster (see [versioning policy](versioning-policy.md)). The purpose of this schedule is to provide dates for when Adobe plans to announce the release of substantial new features.

## Features, cloud infrastructure, and extensibility

New features, feature updates, cloud infrastructure, and extensibility updates are delivered independently from patch releases and are available through external modules, extensions, tools, or web services. Examples include:

- ![Feature icon](../assets/icons/feature.svg) [**Features and functionality**](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce/user-guides/release-information/release-notes-all)—New features and functionality delivered independently from patch releases. For example, [B2B](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-admin/b2b/release-notes), Catalog Service, Data Connection, Live Search, and Product Recommendations.

- ![Infrastructure icon](../assets/icons/servers.svg) [**Cloud infrastructure**](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/release-notes/cloud-tools-suite)—New features and enhancements to Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure and the Cloud Tools Suite for Commerce packages, which deploy and manage Adobe Commerce installations and upgrades on the Cloud platform.

- ![Extensibility icon](../assets/icons/brackets.svg) [**Extensibility**](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/extensibility/)—New developer tools and services for out-of-process extensibility delivered independently from patch releases. For example, Integration Starter Kit, Admin UI SDK, Adobe I/O Events for Commerce, and API Mesh.

The following list provides the dates for scheduled feature, cloud infrastructure, and extensibility releases (dates are subject to change):

- February 11, 2025
- April 8, 2025
- June 10, 2025
- August 12, 2025
- October 14, 2025

>[!NOTE]
>
>Feature, cloud infrastructure, and extensibility releases may vary throughout the year. However, Adobe regularly and continuously releases improvements for these areas between the dates specified on this page. See [What is Adobe Commerce?](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-admin/start/about) to learn more about the latest features.

## Patches

Adobe also releases [patches](versioning-policy.md#patch-release) for each supported release line of the core Adobe Commerce PHP application. Patch releases are opportunities to upgrade the core codebase to keep your platform secure, reliable, and performant.

In addition to the scheduled quality, security, and beta patches listed on this page, Adobe provides access to [individual patches](versioning-policy.md#individual-patch) through the [Quality Patches Tool](../tools/quality-patches-tool/usage.md). The tool allows you to apply, revert, and view general information about all individual patches that are available for the installed version of Adobe Commerce.
