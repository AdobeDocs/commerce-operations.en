# Release schedule

Adobe continually strives to find the right balance between making product upgrades simple and predictable and delivering improvements and new features to early adopters faster. Over the last year, we have refined how we deliver software to support this balance. For additional information, refer to our [versioning policy](versioning-policy.md).

Adobe releases security and functional patches for each supported release line of Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source.

The following table provides the dates for scheduled releases (dates are subject to change):

>[!TIP]
>
>Patch and Security Patch Releases are opportunities to upgrade the core codebase to keep your platform secure, reliable, and performant. Feature Releases occur every other month. Feature Releases are independent of the core codebase and are available through external module or extension. Any updates to existing independent features are released during Feature Release periods and do not happen automatically if the feature is already implemented.

## Early access

Pre-release is General Availability code that is available to Adobe Commerce merchants and all partners two weeks before General Availability. It allows for quicker deployment of code before General Availability.

Beta is non-General Availability code that is available to all partners. It allows for extra time to review code and affected components.

For more information, refer to the [Beta program](beta-program.md).

## Release types

-  **Patch releases**—Updates to the core Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source application that include security, compliance, performance, and high-priority quality fixes.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >
   >Adobe will be releasing beta version patch releases ("Beta Releases"), which are pre-general availability releases of Adobe Commerce features made publicly available to all Adobe Commerce customers and Adobe partners. Beta Releases may contain defects and are provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind. Adobe will have no obligation to maintain, correct, update, change, modify or otherwise support (via Adobe Support Services or otherwise) the Beta Releases. Customer is advised to use caution and not to rely in any way on the correct functioning or performance of the Beta Releases and/or any accompanying documentation or materials. Accordingly, any use of the Beta Releases is entirely at Customer's own risk. 
   
-  **Security patch releases**—Security-only updates to the Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source application released to keep merchants secure and compliant.
-  **Feature releases**—New features and feature updates that are delivered as independent services, separate from the patch releases. Examples include services like Product Recommendations and Live Search, independent modules like PWA Studio and Inventory Management (MSI), and updates to our cloud services and infrastructure.
