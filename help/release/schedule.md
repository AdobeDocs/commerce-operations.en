# Patch release schedule

Adobe continually strives to find the right balance between making product upgrades simple and predictable while delivering improvements to early adopters faster (see [versioning policy](versioning-policy.md)).

The purpose of this schedule is to provide dates for when Adobe plans to announce the release of [patches](versioning-policy.md#patch-release) for each supported release line of the core Adobe Commerce PHP application. Patch releases are opportunities to upgrade the core codebase to keep your platform secure, reliable, and performant.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The release schedule for features, cloud infrastructure, and extensibility is available in the [Adobe Commerce Services](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce/user-guides/release-information/release-notes-all) release documentation.

In addition to the scheduled quality, security, and beta patches listed on this page, Adobe provides access to [individual patches](versioning-policy.md#individual-patch) through the [Quality Patches Tool](../tools/quality-patches-tool/usage.md). The tool allows you to apply, revert, and view general information about all individual patches that are available for the installed version of Adobe Commerce.

>[!TAB 2026 schedule]

Beginning February 2026, Adobe Commerce will move to a monthly patch release schedule with the following strategy:

- **Isolated security fixes**—Individual, non-cumulative [security fixes](versioning-policy.md#isolated-patch) may be released monthly and include security fixes for all [supported](lifecycle-policy.md) release lines (includes regular and extended support).

- **Security patches**—At minimium, [security patches](versioning-policy.md#security-patch-release) are released annually (May) for all [supported](lifecycle-policy.md) release lines (includes regular and extended support). These patches include all previously released isolated security fixes. Adobe may release additional security patches in November if necessary, but it is not guaranteed.

- **Patch**—A full [patch](versioning-policy.md#patch-release) for the Adobe Commerce 2.4.x LTS release line (3-year support period) is released annually (May).

- **Beta patches**—Two [beta patches](versioning-policy.md#beta-patch-release) for the Adobe Commerce 2.4.x LTS release line are released twice a year (February and November).
