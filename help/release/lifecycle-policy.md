# Adobe Commerce lifecycle policy

For Adobe Commerce 2.4.4 and subsequent releases:

- To better streamline our lifecycle policy and to support the mission-critical needs of Adobe Commerce customers, we are expanding our support window to three years from the General Availability (GA) date for Adobe Commerce 2.4.4 and later. Adobe provides quality fixes to the 2.4.4 and later releases for a three-year support period. Customers can access quality fixes by contacting [Adobe Commerce Support](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-knowledge-base/kb/help-center-guide/magento-help-center-user-guide.html) or through the self-serve [[!DNL Quality Patches Tool]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/tools/commerce-quality-patches/index.html) if their version is still eligible for quality support. Refer to the table below for the end of software support dates for Adobe Commerce release lines.

- Adobe provides security fixes through a security patch release for the three-year support period.

- For critical security issues, such as zero-day vulnerabilities, Adobe provides [hotfixes](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/sections/360003869892-Known-issues-patches-attached-) for all customers on a supported version, even if they are not on the latest patch or security patch release. It is important to note that a hotfix is not a catch-all and does not address all the security issues that would be fixed by upgrading to the latest release.
