## Cache types

Commerce 2 has the following cache types:

|Cache type "friendly" name|Cache type code name|Description|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Configuration|config|Commerce collects configuration from all modules, merges it, and saves the merged result to the cache. This cache also contains store-specific settings stored in the file system and database. Clean or flush this cache type after modifying configuration files.|
|Layout|layout|Compiled page layouts (that is, the layout components from all components). Clean or flush this cache type after modifying layout files.|
|Block HTML output|block_html|HTML page fragments per block. Clean or flush this cache type after modifying the view layer.|
|Collections data|collections|Results of database queries. If necessary, Commerce cleans up this cache automatically, but third-party developers can put any data in any segment of the cache. Clean or flush this cache type if your custom module uses logic that results in cache entries that Commerce cannot clean.|
|DDL|db_ddl|Database schema. If necessary, Commerce cleans up this cache automatically, but third-party developers can put any data in any segment of the cache. Clean or flush this cache type after you make custom changes to the database schema. (In other words, updates that Commerce does not make itself.) One way to update the database schema automatically is using the `magento setup:db-schema:upgrade` command.|
|Compiled Config|compiled_config|Compilation configuration|
|Entity attribute value (EAV)|eav|Metadata related to EAV attributes (for example, store labels, links to related PHP code, attribute rendering, search settings, and so on). You should not typically need to clean or flush this cache type.|
|Page cache|full_page|Generated HTML pages. If necessary, Commerce cleans up this cache automatically, but third-party developers can put any data in any segment of the cache. Clean or flush this cache type after modifying code level that affects HTML output. It is recommended to keep this cache enabled because caching HTML improves performance significantly.|
|Reflection|reflection|Removes a dependency between the Webapi module and the Customer module.|
|Translations|translate|After merging translations from all modules, the merger cache will be cleaned.|
|Integration configuration|config_integration|Compiled integrations. Clean or flush this cache after changing or adding integrations.|
|Integration API configuration|config_integration_api|Compiled integration APIs configuration of the Store's Integrations.|
|Web services configuration|config_webservice|Caching the Web API Structure.|
|Customer Notification|customer_notification|Temporary notifications that appear in the user interface.|

## View the cache status

To view the status of the cache, enter

```bash
   bin/magento cache:status
```

<!-- where `--bootstrap=` is a URL-encoded associative array of Commerce [application bootstrap parameters](../bootstrap/set-parameters.md) and values. -->

A sample follows:

```terminal
Current status:
                        config: 1
                        layout: 1
                    block_html: 1
                   collections: 1
                    reflection: 1
                        db_ddl: 1
               compiled_config: 1
                           eav: 1
         customer_notification: 1
                     full_page: 1
            config_integration: 1
        config_integration_api: 1
                   target_rule: 1
             config_webservice: 1
                     translate: 1
```

## Enable or disable cache types

This command enables you to enable or disable all cache types or only the ones you specify. Disabling cache types is useful during development because you see the results of your changes without having to flush the cache; however, disabling cache types has an adverse effect on performance.

>[!INFO]
>
>Starting in version 2.2, you can only enable or disable cache types using the command line while running Commerce in production mode. If running Commerce in developer mode, you can enable or disable cache types using the command line or manually. Before doing so, you must manually make `<magento_root>/app/etc/env.php` writeable by the [file system owner](../../installation/prerequisites/file-system/overview.md).

You can clean (also referred to as _flush_ or _refresh_) cache types using either the command line or the Admin.

Command options:

```bash
bin/magento cache:enable [type] ... [type]
```

```bash
bin/magento cache:disable [type] ... [type]
```

Where omitting `[type]` enables or disables all cache types at the same time. The `type` option is a space-separated list of cache types.

<!-- `--bootstrap=` is a URL-encoded associative array of Commerce [application bootstrap parameters](../bootstrap/set-parameters.md#bootstrap-parameters) and values. -->

To list cache types and their status:

```bash
bin/magento cache:status
```

For example, to disable the full page cache and the DDL cache:

```bash
bin/magento cache:disable db_ddl full_page
```

Sample result:

```terminal
   Changed cache status:
       db_ddl: 1 -> 0
    full_page: 1 -> 0
```

>[!INFO]
>
>Enabling a cache type automatically clears that cache type.

>[!INFO]
>
>As of version 2.3.4, Commerce caches all system EAV attributes as they are retrieved. Caching EAV attributes in this manner improves performance, because it decreases the amount of insert/select requests to the DB. However, it increases cache network size as well. Developers can cache custom EAV attributes by running the `bin/magento config:set dev/caching/cache_user_defined_attributes 1` command. This can also be done from the Admin while in [Developer mode](../bootstrap/application-modes.md) by setting **Stores** > Settings **Configuration** > **Advanced** > **Developer** > **Caching Settings** > **Cache User Defined Attributes** to **Yes**.

## Clean and flush cache types

>[!NOTE]
>
>Multiple pages cache can be invalidated simultaneously and automatically **_without_** these entities editing. For example, when any product in the catalog is assigned to any category, or when any [!UICONTROL related product rule] is modified.

To purge out-of-date items from the cache, you can _clean_ or _flush_ cache types:

-  Cleaning a cache type deletes all items from enabled Commerce cache types only. In other words, this option does not affect other processes or applications because it cleans only the cache that Commerce uses.

   Disabled cache types are not cleaned.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >Always clean the cache after upgrading versions of Magento Open Source or Adobe Commerce, upgrading from Magento Open Source to Adobe Commerce, or installing B2B for Adobe Commerce or any module.

-  Flushing a cache type purges the cache storage, which might affect other processes applications that are using the same storage.

Flush cache types if you have already tried cleaning the cache and you are still having issues that you cannot isolate.

Command usage:

```bash
   bin/magento cache:clean [type] ... [type]
```

```bash
   bin/magento cache:flush [type] ... [type]
```

Where `[type]` is a space-separated list of cache types. Omitting `[type]` cleans or flushes all cache types at the same time. For example, to flush all cache types, enter

```bash
   bin/magento cache:flush
```

Sample result:

```terminal
   Flushed cache types:
   config
   layout
   block_html
   collections
   reflection
   db_ddl
   compiled_config
   eav
   customer_notification
   config_integration
   config_integration_api
   full_page
   config_webservice
   translate
```

>[!TIP]
>
>You can also clean and flush cache types in the Admin. Go to **System** > **Tools** > **Cache Management**. **Flush Cache Storage** is equivalent to `bin/magento cache:flush`. **Flush Magento Cache** is equivalent to `bin/magento cache:clean`.
