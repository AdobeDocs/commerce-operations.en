# Message queues overview

The Message Queue Framework (MQF) is a system that allows a module to publish messages to queues. It also defines the [consumers](consumers.md) that will receive the messages asynchronously. The MQF uses [[!DNL RabbitMQ]](https://www.rabbitmq.com) as the messaging broker, which provides a scalable platform for sending and receiving messages. It also includes a mechanism for storing undelivered messages. [!DNL RabbitMQ] is based on the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) 0.9.1 specification.

The following diagram illustrates the Message Queue Framework:

- A publisher is a component that sends messages to an exchange. It knows which exchange to publish to and the format of the messages it sends.

- An exchange receives messages from publishers and sends them to queues. Although [!DNL RabbitMQ] supports multiple types of exchanges, Commerce uses topic exchanges only. A topic includes a routing key, which contains text strings separated by dots. The format for a topic name is `string1.string2`: for example, `customer.created` or `customer.sent.email`.

   The broker allows you to use wildcards when setting rules for forwarding messages. You can use an asterisk (`*`) to replace _one_ string or a pound sign (`#`) to replace 0 or more strings. For example, `customer.*` would filter on `customer.create` and `customer.delete`, but not `customer.sent.email`. However `customer.#` would filter on `customer.create`,  `customer.delete`, and `customer.sent.email`.

- A queue is a buffer that stores messages.

- A consumer receives messages. It knows which queue to consume. It can map processors of the message to a specific queue.

A basic message queue system can also be set up without using [!DNL RabbitMQ]. In this system, a MySQL adapter stores messages in the database. Three database tables (`queue`, `queue_message`, and `queue_message_status`) manage the message queue workload. Cron jobs ensure the consumers are able to receive messages. This solution is not very scalable. [!DNL RabbitMQ] should be used whenever possible.
