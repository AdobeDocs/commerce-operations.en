| Creates a temporary database table, moves each [customer segment](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/marketing/customer-segments.html) into it, deletes all segments that match the segment ID, and copies them to the customer segments using the segment ID as the indicator. This is all done in a transaction so that if something fails, it rolls back the transaction to what it was before this executed. After a transaction, the consumer drops the temporary table.                                                               |                |                         |                     |
