## Commerce Admin configuration

There are corresponding topics in the [Commerce User Guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-admin/config/guide-overview) that can help you to understand field descriptions for every configuration setting in the Commerce Admin.

## Cloud configuration

[!DNL Commerce on cloud infrastructure] uses a [set of configuration files](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/configure/overview.html) to update the Commerce application features and services in the hosted environments. Because of the unique nature of the Adobe cloud-hosted environments, you should always review the [Cloud guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/overview.html) for additional configuration requirements.
