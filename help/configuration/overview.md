- [Deployment methods](../configuration/deployment/overview.md)
- [Caching options](../configuration/cache/caching-overview.md)
- [Cron job management](../configuration/cron/custom-cron.md)
- [Command-line usage](../configuration/cli/config-cli.md)
- [Log customization](../configuration/logs/custom-logging.md)
- [Security options](../configuration/security/overview.md)
- [Search engine settings](../configuration/search/configure-search-engine.md)
- [Storage methods](../configuration/storage/memcached.md)

## Commerce Admin configuration

There are corresponding topics in the [Commerce User Guide](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/stores/configuration.html) that can help you to understand field descriptions for every configuration setting in the Commerce Admin.

## Cloud configuration

[!DNL Commerce on cloud infrastructure] uses a [set of configuration files](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/configure/overview.html) to update the Commerce application features and services in the hosted environments. Because of the unique nature of the Adobe cloud-hosted environments, you should always review the [Cloud guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/overview.html) for additional configuration requirements.
