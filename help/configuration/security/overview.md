# Security overview

The Security section includes settings for security-related features, such as password hashing, cache poisoning, and securing the `cron.php` file.

## Security resources

The topics in the Security section of the Configuration guide are not comprehensive across all Commerce functionality. There are many important security-related topics in other Commerce guides, such as:

- [PHP Developer guide](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/php/development/security/) for information that Adobe Commerce developers can use to improve the security of the components that they build.
- [Security and Compliance guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-operations/security-and-compliance/overview) for information about security, privacy, and regulation compliance, with links to technical resources.

Several security-related topics that were included in the Configuration guide at one time, are now located in the following guides:

- [Google reCAPTCHA](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-admin/systems/security/captcha/security-google-recaptcha) in the _Extension guide_.
- [Two-Factor Authentication](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/testing/functional-testing-framework/two-factor-authentication/) in the _Extension guide_.
- [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-operations/security-and-compliance/privacy/gdpr) in the _Security and Compliance guide_.
