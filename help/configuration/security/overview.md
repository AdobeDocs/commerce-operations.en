# Security overview

The Security section includes settings for security-related features, such as password hashing, cache poisoning, and securing the `cron.php` file.

## Security resources

The topics in the Security section of the Configuration guide are not comprehensive across all Commerce functionality. There are many important security-related topics in other Commerce guides, such as:

- [PHP Developer guide](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/php/development/security/) for information that Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source developers can use to improve the security of the components that they build.
- [Security and Compliance guide](https://devdocs.magento.com/security/security-and-compliance.html) for information about security, privacy, and regulation compliance, with links to technical resources.

Several security-related topics that were included in the Configuration guide at one time, are now located in the following guides:

- [Google reCAPTCHA](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/security/google-recaptcha.html) in the _Extension guide_.
- [Two-Factor Authentication](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/security/two-factor-authentication.html) in the _Extension guide_.
- [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance](https://devdocs.magento.com/compliance/privacy/gdpr.html) in the _Security and Compliance guide_.
