# Configure image resizing for remote storage

By default, Adobe Commerce supports image resizing on the application side. However, by enabling the Remote Storage module, you can use Nginx to offload image resizing to the server side, where you can save disk resources and optimize disk usage.

The following diagram shows how Nginx retrieves, resizes, and stores images in the cache. Resizing is determined by the parameters included in the URL, such as height and width.

## Configure URL format in Adobe Commerce

To resize images on the server side, you must configure Adobe Commerce to provide arguments for the height, width, and location (URL) of the image.

**To configure Commerce for server-side image resizing**:

1. In the _Admin_ panel, click **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL General]** > **[!UICONTROL Web]**.

1. In the right pane, expand **[!UICONTROL Url options]**.

1. In the _Catalog media URL format_ section, clear **[!UICONTROL Use system value]**.

1. Select the `Image optimization based on query parameters` URL in the **_Catalog media URL format_** field.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save Config]**.

1. Continue to the [Nginx configuration](#configure-nginx).

## Configure Nginx

To continue configuring server-side image resizing, you must prepare the `nginx.conf` file and provide a `proxy_pass` value for your chosen adapter.

**To enable Nginx to resize images**:

1. Install the [Nginx image filter module][nginx-module].

   ```shell
   load_module /etc/nginx/modules/ngx_http_image_filter_module.so;
   ```

1. Create an `nginx.conf` file based on the included template `nginx.conf.sample` file. For example:

   ```conf
   location ~* \.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|webp)$ {
       set $width "-";
       set $height "-";
       if ($arg_width != '') {
           set $width $arg_width;
       }
       if ($arg_height != '') {
           set $height $arg_height;
       }
       image_filter resize $width $height;
       image_filter_jpeg_quality 90;
   }
   ```

1. [_Optional_] Configure a `proxy_pass` value for your specific adapter.
