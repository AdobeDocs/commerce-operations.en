# Configure AWS S3 bucket for remote storage

The [Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)][AWS S3] is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. The AWS S3 service uses buckets, or containers, for data storage. This configuration requires you to create a _private_ bucket. For Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure, see [Configure remote storage for Commerce on Cloud infrastructure](cloud-support.md).

>[!WARNING]
>
>Adobe highly discourages the use of public buckets because it poses a serious security risk.

**To enable remote storage with the AWS S3 adapter**:

1. Log in to your Amazon S3 dashboard and create a _private_ bucket.

1. Set up [AWS IAM][] roles. Alternatively, generate access and secret keys.

1. Disable the default database storage.

   ```bash
   bin/magento config:set system/media_storage_configuration/media_database 0
   ```

1. Configure Commerce to use the private bucket. See [Remote storage options](remote-storage.md#remote-storage-options) for a full list of parameters.

   ```bash
   bin/magento setup:config:set --remote-storage-driver="aws-s3" --remote-storage-bucket="<bucket-name>" --remote-storage-region="<region-name>" --remote-storage-prefix="<optional-prefix>" --remote-storage-key=<optional-access-key> --remote-storage-secret=<optional-secret-key> -n
   ```

1. Synchronize media files with remote storage.

   ```bash
   bin/magento remote-storage:sync
   ```

## Configure Nginx

Nginx requires additional configuration to perform Authentication with the `proxy_pass` directive. Add the following proxy information to the `nginx.conf` file:

>nginx.conf

```conf
location ~* \.(ico|jpg|jpeg|png|gif|svg|js|css|swf|eot|ttf|otf|woff|woff2)$ {
    # Proxying to AWS S3 storage.
    resolver 8.8.8.8;
    set $bucket "<s3-bucket-name>";
    proxy_pass https://s3.amazonaws.com/$bucket$uri;
    proxy_pass_request_body off;
    proxy_pass_request_headers off;
    proxy_intercept_errors on;
    proxy_hide_header "x-amz-id-2";
    proxy_hide_header "x-amz-request-id";
    proxy_hide_header "x-amz-storage-class";
    proxy_hide_header "Set-Cookie";
    proxy_ignore_headers "Set-Cookie";
}
```

### Authentication

If you use access and secret keys instead of [AWS IAM][] roles, you must include the [`ngx_aws_auth` Nginx module][ngx repo].

### Permissions

The S3 integration relies on the ability to generate and store cached images on the local file system. Therefore, folder permissions for `pub/media` and similar directories are the same for S3 as they are when using local storage.

### File Operations

It is highly recommended that you use [!DNL Commerce] file adapter methods in your coding or extension development, regardless of the file storage type. When using S3 for storage, do not use native PHP file I/O operations, such as `copy`, `rename`, or `file_put_contents`, because S3 files are not located within the file system. See [DriverInterface.php](https://github.com/magento/magento2/blob/2.4-develop/lib/internal/Magento/Framework/Filesystem/DriverInterface.php#L18) for code examples.
