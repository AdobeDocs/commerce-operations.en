# Configure search stopwords

In general, _stopwords_ are common words that search engines filter out after processing text. Originally, when disk space and memory were extremely limited, every kilobyte saved meant a significant improvement in performance. Therefore, search engines achieved performance gains by ignoring certain words and keeping the index small.

Although we have more storage today, performance is still important. Elasticsearch and OpenSearch, like other search engines, still use stopwords to improve performance.

You must manage your stopwords using CSV files located in the `<magento_root>/vendor/magento/module-elasticsearch/etc/stopwords` directory or the `<magento_root>/app/code/Magento/Elasticsearch/etc/stopwords/` directory, depending on how you installed the Commerce software.

For more information about how Elasticsearch and OpenSearch uses stopwords, see the following resources:

## Configure stopwords

Stopwords are located in the `<magento_root>/vendor/magento/module-elasticsearch/etc/stopwords` directory. Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source ships with one CSV file containing stopwords for the default locales and an additional file, `stopwords.csv`, which has stopwords for any locale that is not represented by another CSV file.

The default lifetime for stopwords file cache is 15 minutes.

### Edit stopwords for an existing locale

**To edit stopwords**:

1. Log in to your Commerce server, or switch to, the [file system owner](../../installation/prerequisites/file-system/overview.md).
1. Use a text editor to open a stopword file in the `<magento_root>/vendor/magento/module-elasticsearch/etc/stopwords` directory.

   CSV files use the naming convention `stopwords_<locale_code>.csv`. For example, the German stopword file is named `stopwords_de_DE.csv`.

1. Add words, remove words, or change words in the file.

   (Each stopword in a file starts on a new line.)

1. Save your changes and exit the text editor.
1. Clean the configuration cache.

   - Admin: **System** > Tools > **Cache Management**. Select the **Configuration** checkbox and, from the list above it, click **Refresh**. Click **Submit** to complete the action.

   - Command line: As the file system owner, enter the following command:

      ```bash
      php <magento_root>/bin/magento cache:clean config
      ```

1. Check the results by searching for terms on your storefront.

### Create stopwords for a new locale

**To add stopwords for a locale**:

1. Log in to your Commerce server, or switch to, the [file system owner](../../installation/prerequisites/file-system/overview.md).

1. Use a text editor to create a stopword file named `stopwords_<locale_code>.csv` in the `<magento_root>/vendor/magento/module-elasticsearch/etc/stopwords` directory.

   For example, to create stopwords for the Italian locale, name the file `stopwords_it_IT.csv`.

1. In your stopword file, make sure that each stopword is on a separate line.
1. Save your changes and exit the text editor.
1. In the same directory, open `esconfig.xml` in a text editor.
1. Add a line to `esconfig.xml` as follows:

   ```xml
   <LOCALE_CODE>stopwords_LOCALE_CODE.csv</LOCALE_CODE>
   ```

   For example, to add an Italian stopword file, add the following line:

   ```xml
   <it_IT>stopwords_it_IT.csv</it_IT>
   ```

1. Save the changes to `esconfig.xml` and exit the text editor.
1. Clean the configuration cache.

   - Admin: **System** > Tools > **Cache Management**. Select the **Configuration** checkbox and, from the list above it, click **Refresh**. Click **Submit** to complete the action.

   - Command line: As the file system owner, enter the following command:

      ```bash
      php <magento_root>/bin/magento magento cache:clean config
      ```

1. Check the results by searching for terms on your storefront.

## Change the stopword directory

This section discusses how to optionally change the default stopword directory from one of the following:

- `<magento_root>/vendor/magento/module-elasticsearch/etc/stopwords`
- `<magento_root>/app/code/Magento/Elasticsearch/etc/stopwords/`

The location depends on how you installed the Commerce software. If you cloned the Magento 2 GitHub repository, the path is under `app/code`. If you installed a compressed archive or a metapackage, the path is under `vendor`.

**To change the directory**:

1. As the file system owner, open the Elasticsearch `di.xml` in a text editor.

   If you cloned the repository, it is located at `app/code/Magento/Elasticsearch/etc/di.xml`

   If you got an archive or the metapackage, it is located at `vendor/magento/module-elasticsearch/etc/di.xml`

1. Change the value of `stopwordsDirectory` to the desired directory:

   ```xml
   <type name="Magento\Elasticsearch\SearchAdapter\Query\Preprocessor\Stopwords">
       <arguments>
           <argument name="stopwordsDirectory" xsi:type="string">app/code/Magento/Elasticsearch/etc/stopwords</argument>
       </arguments>
   </type>
   ```

1. Save your changes to `di.xml` and exit the text editor.

## To change the directory from your module

1. [Create a module](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/php/development/build/component-file-structure/)
1. In your module `etc/di.xml` add instructions:

   ```xml
   <type name="Magento\Elasticsearch\SearchAdapter\Query\Preprocessor\Stopwords">
       <arguments>
          <argument name="stopwordsModule" xsi:type="string">Your_Module</argument>
          <argument name="stopwordsDirectory" xsi:type="string">stopwords</argument>
       </arguments>
   </type>
   ```

1. In your module, create the directory `etc/stopwords`, with the corresponding CSV file.

1. Save your changes to `di.xml` and exit the text editor.
