# Search engine overview

As of version 2.4.4, Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source requires either [Elasticsearch][] or [OpenSearch][] to be the catalog search engine. Previous versions of 2.4.x required Elasticsearch. Refer to the following topics for details about installing a search engine and initial configuration:

- [Search engine prerequisites](../../installation/prerequisites/search-engine/overview.md)
- [Configure nginx for your search engine](../../installation/prerequisites/search-engine/configure-nginx.md)
- [Configure Apache for your search engine](../../installation/prerequisites/search-engine/configure-apache.md)
- [Install the Commerce software](../../installation/composer.md) (command-line interface)

After you install and integrate your search engine with Adobe Commerce, you must perform additional maintenance:

- [Configure search stopwords](search-stopwords.md)
- [Search engine configuration](configure-search-engine.md)
