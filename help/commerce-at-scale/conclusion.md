# Conclusion

This content is intended to be a high-level guide to provide some areas to investigate initially while preparing your AEM/CIF/Adobe Commerce environment for heavy load. There are many areas of Adobe Commerce, CIF, and Fastly that are not covered by the above guide which will require optimisations specific to your environment. Also, custom code and 3rd party modules may have effects on response times which cannot be covered here.

To mitigate the risk of changes or code being introduced that will negatively affect the AEM/CIF/Adobe Commerce end user response times, it should be ensured that a thorough and repeatable performance test strategy is put in place, including defining KPIâ€™s that can be measured over time. Performance testing should be carried out not only prior to go live but also continuing after go-live, ideally before each major release or change to your production environments to measure any performance impacts.
