# Quick start on-premises installation

We use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to manage Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source components and their dependencies. Using Composer to get the Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source metapackage provides the following advantages:

-  Reuse third-party libraries without bundling them with source code
-  Reduce extension conflicts and compatibility issues by using a component-based architecture with robust dependency management
-  Adhere to [PHP-Framework Interoperability Group (FIG)](https://www.php-fig.org/) standards
-  Repackage Magento Open Source with other components
-  Use the Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source software in a production environment

>[!NOTE]
>
>Developers contributing to Magento Open Source should use the [git-based](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/contributor/guides/install/) installation method.

## Prerequisites

Before you continue, you must do the following:

-  Complete all [prerequisite tasks](system-requirements.md).
-  [Install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/).
-  Get [authentication keys](prerequisites/authentication-keys.md) to the Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source Composer repository.

## Log in as file system owner

Learn about ownership, permissions, and the file system owner in our [Overview of ownership and permissions topic](prerequisites/file-system/overview.md).

To switch to the file system owner:

1. Log in to the application server as, or switch to, a user with permissions to write to the file system.

   If you use the bash shell, you can use the following syntax to switch to the file system owner and enter the command at the same time:

   ```bash
   su <file system owner> -s /bin/bash -c <command>
   ```

   If the file system owner does not allow logins, you can do the following:

   ```bash
   sudo -u <file system owner>  <command>
   ```

1. To run CLI commands from any directory, add `<app_root>/bin` to your system `PATH`.

   Because shells have differing syntax, consult a reference like [unix.stackexchange.com](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/117467/how-to-permanently-set-environmental-variables).

   Sample bash shell for CentOS:

   ```bash
   export PATH=$PATH:/var/www/html/magento2/bin
   ```

   Optionally, you can run the commands in the following ways:

   -  `cd <app_root>/bin` and run them as `./magento <command name>`
   -  `app_root>/bin/magento <command name>`
   -  `<app_root>` is a subdirectory of your web server docroot

## Get the metapackage

To get the Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source metapackage:

1. Log in to your application server as, or switch to, the [file system owner](prerequisites/file-system/overview.md).
1. Change to the web server docroot directory or a directory that you have configured as a virtual host docroot.
1. Create Composer project using the Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source metapackage.

    **Magento Open Source**

    ```bash
    composer create-project --repository-url=https://repo.magento.com/ magento/project-community-edition <install-directory-name>
    ```

    **Adobe Commerce**

    ```bash
    composer create-project --repository-url=https://repo.magento.com/ magento/project-enterprise-edition <install-directory-name>
    ```

    When prompted, enter your authentication keys. Public and private keys are created and configured in your [Commerce Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/customer/account/login/).

    If you encounter errors, such as `Could not find package...` or `...no matching package found`, make sure that there are no typos in your command. If you still encounter errors, you may not be authorized to download Adobe Commerce. Contact [Adobe Commerce Support](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us) for help.

    See [Troubleshooting](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033818091) for help with more errors.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >Adobe Commerce customers can access patches two weeks before the General Availability (GA) date. Pre-release packages are available through Composer only. You cannot access pre-releases on the Developer Portal or GitHub until GA. If you cannot find these packages in Composer, contact Adobe Commerce Support.

### Example - Minor release

Minor releases contain new features, quality fixes, and security fixes. Use Composer to specify a minor release. For example, to specify the Adobe Commerce 2.4.5 metapackage:

```bash
composer create-project --repository-url=https://repo.magento.com/ magento/project-enterprise-edition=2.4.5 <install-directory-name>
```

### Example - Quality patch

Quality patches primarily contain functional _and_ security fixes. However, they can also sometimes contain new, backward-compatible features. Use Composer to download a quality patch. For example, to specify the Adobe Commerce 2.4.5 metapackage:

```bash
composer create-project --repository-url=https://repo.magento.com/ magento/project-enterprise-edition=2.4.5 <install-directory-name>
```

### Example - Security patch

Security patches contain security fixes only. They are designed to make the upgrade process faster and easier.

Security patches use the Composer naming convention `2.4.5-px`. Use Composer to specify a patch. For example, to download the Adobe Commerce 2.4.5-p1 metapackage:

```bash
composer create-project --repository-url=https://repo.magento.com/ magento/project-enterprise-edition=2.4.5-p1 <install-directory-name>
```

## Set file permissions

You must set read-write permissions for the web server group before you install Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source. This is necessary so that the command line can write files to the file system.

```terminal
cd /var/www/html/<magento install directory>
find var generated vendor pub/static pub/media app/etc -type f -exec chmod g+w {} +
find var generated vendor pub/static pub/media app/etc -type d -exec chmod g+ws {} +
chown -R :www-data . # Ubuntu
chmod u+x bin/magento
```

## Install the application

You must use the command line to install Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source.

This example assumes that the install directory is named `magento2ee`, the `db-host` is on the same machine (`localhost`), and that the `db-name`, `db-user`, and `db-password` are all `magento`:

```bash
bin/magento setup:install \
--base-url=http://localhost/magento2ee \
--db-host=localhost \
--db-name=magento \
--db-user=magento \
--db-password=magento \
--admin-firstname=admin \
--admin-lastname=admin \
--admin-email=admin@admin.com \
--admin-user=admin \
--admin-password=admin123 \
--language=en_US \
--currency=USD \
--timezone=America/Chicago \
--use-rewrites=1 \
--search-engine=opensearch \
--opensearch-host=os-host.example.com \
--opensearch-port=9200 \
--opensearch-index-prefix=magento2 \
--opensearch-timeout=15
```

>[!TIP]
>
>You can customize the Admin URI with the `--backend-frontname` option. However, we recommend omitting this option and allowing the installation command to automatically generate a random URI. A random URI is harder for hackers or malicious software to exploit. The URI displays in your console when installation is complete.
