## Command-line interface (CLI)

Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source have a single command-line interface for installation and configuration tasks: `<magento_root>/bin/magento`. The interface performs multiple tasks, including:

*  Installation (and related tasks such as creating or updating the database schema, creating the deployment configuration).
*  Clearing the cache.
*  Managing indexes, including reindexing.
*  Creating translation dictionaries and translation packages.
*  Generating non-existent classes such as factories and interceptors for plug-ins, generating the dependency injection configuration for the object manager.
*  Deploying static view files.
*  Creating CSS from Less.

Other benefits:

*  A single command (`<magento_root>/bin/magento list`) lists all available installation and configuration commands.
*  Consistent user interface based on Symfony.
*  The CLI is extensible so third-party developers can "plug in" to it. This has the additional benefit of eliminating users' learning curve.
*  Commands for disabled modules do not display.

This topic discusses installing the Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source software using the CLI. For information about configuration, see the [Configuration Guide](../configuration/overview.md).

The installer can be run multiple times if necessary so you can:

*  Provide different values

   For example, after you configure your web server for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), you can run the installer to set SSL options.

*  Correct mistakes in previous installations
*  Install Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source in a different database instance

## Before you start your installation

Before you begin, complete the following steps:

*  Verify that your system meets the requirements discussed in [system requirements](system-requirements.md).

*  Complete all [prerequisite](prerequisites/overview.md) tasks.

*  Complete the first installation steps. See [your install or upgrade path](overview.md).

*  After you log in to the application server, [switch to the file system owner](prerequisites/file-system/overview.md).

*  Review the [installation quick start](composer.md) overview.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You must install Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source from the `bin` subdirectory.

You can run the installer multiple times with different options to complete installation tasks like the following:

*  Install in phases â€” For example, after you configure your web server for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), you can run the installer again to set SSL options.

*  Correct mistakes in previous installations.

*  Install Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source in a different database instance.

>[!NOTE]
>
>By default, the installer does not overwrite the database if you install the software in the same database instance. You can use the optional `cleanup-database` parameter to change this behavior.

See also [Update, reinstall, uninstall](tutorials/uninstall.md).

### Secure installation

{{$include /help/_includes/secure-install.md}}

## Installer help commands

You can run the following commands to find values for some required arguments:

| Installer argument | Command                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Language           | bin/magento info:language:list      |
| Currency           | bin/magento info:currency:list      |
| Time zone          | bin/magento info:timezone:list      |

>[!NOTE]
>
>If an error displays when you run these commands, verify that you updated installation dependencies as discussed in [Update installation dependencies](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/contributor/guides/install/update-dependencies/).

## Install from the command line

The install command uses the following format:

```bash
bin/magento setup:install --<option>=<value> ... --<option>=<value>
```

The following tables describe the installation option names and values. For example installation commands, see [Sample localhost installations](#sample-localhost-installations).

>[!NOTE]
>
>Any options that contain spaces or special characters must be enclosed in either single or double quotes.

**Admin credentials:**

The following options specify the user information and credentials for the Admin user.

You can create the Admin user during or after installation. If you create the user during installation, all admin credential variables are required. See [Sample localhost installations](#sample-localhost-installations).

The following tables provide many but not all available install parameters. For a complete list, see the [Command-line Tools Reference](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/reference/cli/magento.html).

### Sample localhost installations

The following examples show the commands to install Adobe Commerce locally with various options.

#### Example 1â€”Basic installation with admin user account

The following example installs Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source with the following options:

*  The application is installed in the `magento2` directory relative to the web server docroot on `localhost` and the path to the Admin is `admin`; therefore:

   Your storefront URL is `http://127.0.0.1`

*  The database server is on the same host as the web server.

   The database name is `magento`, and the username and password are both `magento`

*  Uses server rewrites

*  The administrator has the following properties:

    *  First and last names are `Magento User`
    *  Username is `admin` and the password is `admin123`
    *  E-mail address is `user@example.com`

*  Default language is `en_US` (U.S. English)
*  Default currency is U.S. dollars
*  Default time zone is U.S. Central (America/Chicago)
*  OpenSearch 1.2 is installed on `os-host.example.com` and connects on port 9200

```bash
magento setup:install --base-url=http://127.0.0.1/magento2/ \
--db-host=localhost --db-name=magento --db-user=magento --db-password=magento \
--admin-firstname=Magento --admin-lastname=User --admin-email=user@example.com \
--admin-user=admin --admin-password=admin123 --language=en_US \
--currency=USD --timezone=America/Chicago --use-rewrites=1 \
--search-engine=opensearch --opensearch-host=os-host.example.com \
--opensearch-port=9200
```

Messages similar to the following display to indicate a successful installation:

```terminal
Post installation file permissions check...
For security, remove write permissions from these directories: '/var/www/html/magento2/app/etc'
[Progress: 274 / 274]
[SUCCESS]: Magento installation complete.
[SUCCESS]: Admin Panel URI: /admin_puu71q
```

#### Example 2â€” Basic install without admin user account

You can install Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source without creating the administrator user as shown in the following example.

```bash
magento setup:install --base-url=http://127.0.0.1/magento2/ \
--db-host=localhost --db-name=magento --db-user=magento --db-password=magento \
--language=en_US --currency=USD --timezone=America/Chicago --use-rewrites=1 \
--search-engine=opensearch --opensearch-host=os-host.example.com \
--opensearch-port=9200
```

Messages like the following display if the installation is successful:

```terminal
Post installation file permissions check...
For security, remove write permissions from these directories: '/var/www/html/magento2/app/etc'
[Progress: 274 / 274]
[SUCCESS]: Magento installation complete.
[SUCCESS]: Admin Panel URI: /admin_puu71q
```

After installation you can create an admin user using the `admin:user:create` command:
[Create or edit an administrator](tutorials/admin.md#create-or-edit-an-administrator)

#### Example 3â€”Install with additional options

The following example installs Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source with the following options:

*  The application is installed in the `magento2` directory relative to the web server docroot on `localhost` and the path to the Admin is `admin`; therefore:

   Your storefront URL is `http://127.0.0.1`

*  The database server is on the same host as the web server.

   The database name is `magento`, and the username and password are both `magento`

*  The administrator has the following properties:

    *  First and last names are `Magento User`
    *  Username is `admin` and the password is `admin123`
    *  E-mail address is `user@example.com`

*  Default language is `en_US` (U.S. English)
*  Default currency is U.S. dollars
*  Default time zone is U.S. Central (America/Chicago)
*  The installer first cleans up the database before installing the tables and schema
*  You can use the sales order increment prefix `ORD$` (since it contains a special character [`$`], the value must be enclosed in double quotes)
*  Session data is saved in the database
*  Uses server rewrites
*  OpenSearch is installed on `os-host.example.com` and connects on port 9200

```bash
magento setup:install --base-url=http://127.0.0.1/magento2/ \
--db-host=localhost --db-name=magento --db-user=magento --db-password=magento \
--admin-firstname=Magento --admin-lastname=User --admin-email=user@example.com \
--admin-user=admin --admin-password=admin123 --language=en_US \
--currency=USD --timezone=America/Chicago --cleanup-database \
--sales-order-increment-prefix="ORD$" --session-save=db --use-rewrites=1 \
--search-engine=opensearch --opensearch-host=os-host.example.com \
--opensearch-port=9200
```

>[!NOTE]
>
>You must enter the command either on a single line or, as in the preceding example, with a `\` character at the end of each line.

Messages like the following display if the installation is successful:

```terminal
Post installation file permissions check...
For security, remove write permissions from these directories: '/var/www/html/magento2/app/etc'
[Progress: 274 / 274]
[SUCCESS]: Magento installation complete.
[SUCCESS]: Admin Panel URI: /admin_puu71q
```
