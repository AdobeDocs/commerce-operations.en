## Useful information

Use the links on the left side of the page to navigate topics in each part of the installation.

## Required server permissions

UNIX systems require `root` privileges to install and configure software like a web server, PHP. If you need to install this software, make sure you have `root` access.

Do *not* install the application in the web server docroot as the `root` user because the web server might not be able to interact with those files.

You need `root` privileges to create the [file system owner](file-system/overview.md) and add that owner to the web server's group. You use the file system owner to run `bin/magento` commands from the command line and to set up cron jobs, which schedule tasks for you.
