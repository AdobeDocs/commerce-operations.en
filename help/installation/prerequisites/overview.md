# On-premises installation prerequisites

Before you install Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source, you must do the following:

*  Set up one or more hosts that meet the [system requirements](../system-requirements.md).
*  If you are setting up more than one web node with load balancing, set up and test that part of your system _before_ you install the application.
*  Make sure you can back up your entire system at various points during the installation so that you can roll it back if there are issues.

>[!NOTE]
>
>We assume you are installing the Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source in a **development environment**, that you have root user access to the machine, **and** that the machine does not need to be highly secure. If you are setting up a more secure machine, we strongly recommend you consult a network administrator for additional assistance.

We strongly recommend you update and upgrade your operating system software. These upgrades can provide security and software fixes that might prevent future problems. Do not know what any of this means? Check out our [installation overview page](../overview.md).

Enter the following commands as a user with `root` privileges:

*  Ubuntu

   ```bash
   apt-get update
   ```

   ```bash
   apt-get upgrade
   ```

*  CentOS

   ```bash
   yum -y update
   ```

   ```bash
   yum -y upgrade
   ```

## Prerequisite check

To check your system for prerequisites, enter the following commands:

```

Check that you have the correct version of MySQL for the version of Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source you are installing ([check here for supported versions](../system-requirements.md). The following result indicates the version that you are running.)

```terminal
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.

Type `help` or `\h` for help. Type `\c` to clear the current input statement.

Enter `exit` at the `mysql>` prompt to exit.

```

To verify your Elasticsearch installation:

```bash
curl -XGET '<elasticsearch-hostname>:<elasticsearch-port>'
