# System requirements

The following summarizes software dependencies and services tested for Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source.

There are some differences in the dependencies for Commerce on Cloud infrastructure. Service version and compatibility support for Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure is determined by services tested and deployed to the hosted cloud environments, and sometimes differ from versions supported by Adobe Commerce on-premises deployments. For example, Elasticsearch 7.17 is supported for Commerce 2.4.4 for on-premise deployments, but OpenSearch 1.2 is supported for Commerce 2.4.4 on Cloud infrastructure.

The following tables show versions of third-party software dependencies that Adobe has tested with specific Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source releases.

Adobe only supports the combination of system requirements described in the following tables. For example, 2.4.5 is fully tested with MariaDB 10.4. Adobe recommends that you upgrade to MariaDB 10.4 before upgrading to 2.4.5.

The [Commerce on Cloud template](https://github.com/magento/magento-cloud) provides a default configuration for services compatible with a specific Commerce version.

{{$include /help/_includes/templated/cloud-requirements-table.md}}

The services and versions are defined in [the `services.yaml` file](https://github.com/magento/magento-cloud/blob/master/.magento/services.yaml). The following is the default service configuration for Commerce 2.4.6 on Cloud infrastructure:

```yaml
mysql:
    type: mysql:10.6
    disk: 5120

redis:
    type: redis:7.0

opensearch:
    type: opensearch:2
    disk: 1024
```

See [Configure services](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/configure/service/services-yaml.html) in the _Commerce on Cloud Infrastructure_ guide.

## PHP settings

There are particular PHP configuration settings, such as the `memory_limit` setting, which can help you to avoid common problems when using Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source. See [Required PHP settings](prerequisites/php-settings.md).

For Cloud configuration guidance, see [PHP settings](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/configure/app/php-settings.html) in the _Commerce on Cloud Infrastructure_ guide.

### PHP OPcache

It is recommended that you verify that [PHP OPcache](https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.opcache.php) is enabled for performance reasons. The OPcache is enabled in many PHP distributions. The `opcache` extension is installed by default in the Commerce on Cloud infrastructure.

For on-premesis, verify that PHP OPcache it is installed, see [PHP settings](prerequisites/php-settings.md). Or for specific guidance on performance settings, see the software recommendations for [PHP settings](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/performance-best-practices/software.html#php-settings) in the _Performance Best Practices_ guide.

If you must install OPcache separately, see the [PHP OPcache documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/opcache.setup.php).

### PHPUnit

PHPUnit (as a command-line tool) 9.0.0

### PHP extensions

The [PHP installation instructions](prerequisites/php-settings.md) include a step for installing these extensions.
