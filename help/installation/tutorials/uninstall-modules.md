# Uninstall modules

This section discusses how to uninstall one or more modules. During uninstallation, you can optionally remove the modules' code, database schema, and database data. You can create backups first so you can recover the data later.

You should uninstall a module only if you're certain you won't use it. Instead of uninstalling a module, you can disable it as discussed in [Enable or disable modules](manage-modules.md).

>[!NOTE]
>
>This command checks that only dependencies declared in the `composer.json` file. If you uninstall a module that is _not_ defined in the `composer.json` file, this command uninstalls the module without checking for dependencies. This command does _not_, however, remove the module's code from the file system. You must use file system tools to remove the module's code (for example, `rm -rf <path to module>`). As an alternative, you can [disable](manage-modules.md) non-Composer modules.

Command usage:

```bash
bin/magento module:uninstall [--backup-code] [--backup-media] [--backup-db] [-r|--remove-data] [-c|--clear-static-content] \
  {ModuleName} ... {ModuleName}
```

Where `{ModuleName}` specifies the module name in `<VendorName>_<ModuleName>` format. For example, the Customer module name is `Magento_Customer`. To get a list of module names, enter `magento module:status`

The module uninstall command performs the following tasks:

1. Verifies that the specified modules exist in the code base and are packages installed by Composer.

   This command works _only_ with modules defined as Composer packages.

1. Checks for dependencies with other modules and terminates the command if there are any unmet dependencies.

   To work around this, you can either uninstall all modules at the same time or you can uninstall the dependent modules first.

1. Requests confirmation to proceed.
1. Puts the store in maintenance mode.
1. Processes the following command options.

    | Option           | Meaning                                                                          | Backup file name and location                |
    | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
    | `--backup-code`  | Backs up the file system (excluding `var` and `pub/static` directories). | `var/backups/<timestamp>_filesystem.tgz`       |
    | `--backup-media` | Backs up the pub/media directory.                                                | `var/backups/<timestamp>_filesystem_media.tgz` |
    | `--backup-db`    | Backs up the database.                                                 | `var/backups/<timestamp>_db.gz`                |

1. If `--remove-data` is specified, remove the database schema and data defined in the module's `Uninstall` classes.

   For each specified module to uninstall, invokes the `uninstall` method in its `Uninstall` class. This class must inherit from [Magento\Framework\Setup\UninstallInterface](https://github.com/magento/magento2/blob/2.4/lib/internal/Magento/Framework/Setup/UninstallInterface.php).

1. Removes the specified modules from the `setup_module` database table.
1. Removes the specified modules from the module list in the [deployment configuration](../../configuration/reference/deployment-files.md).
1. Removes code from the codebase using `composer remove`.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Uninstalling a module _always_ runs `composer remove`. The `--remove-data` option removes database data and schema defined by the module's `Uninstall` class.

1. Cleans the cache.
1. Updates generated classes.
1. If `--clear-static-content` is specified, cleans [generated static view files](../../configuration/cli/static-view-file-deployment.md).
1. Takes the store out of maintenance mode.

For example, if you attempt to uninstall a module that another module depends on, the following message displays:

```terminal
magento module:uninstall Magento_SampleMinimal
    Cannot uninstall module 'Magento_SampleMinimal' because the following module(s) depend on it:
        Magento_SampleModifyContent
```

One alternative is to uninstall both modules after backing up the module file system, `pub/media` files, and database tables but _not_ removing the module's database schema or data:

```bash
bin/magento module:uninstall Magento_SampleMinimal Magento_SampleModifyContent --backup-code --backup-media --backup-db
```

Messages similar to the following display:

```terminal
You are about to remove code and/or database tables. Are you sure?[y/N]y

>[!NOTE]
>
>Errors display if you attempt to uninstall a module with a dependency on another module. In that case, you cannot uninstall one module; you must uninstall both.

## Roll back the file system, database, or media files

To restore the codebase to the state at which you backed it up, use the following command:

```bash
bin/magento setup:rollback [-c|--code-file="<filename>"] [-m|--media-file="<filename>"] [-d|--db-file="<filename>"]
```

Where `<filename>` is the name of the backup file in the `<app_root>/var/backups` directory. To display a list of backup files, enter `magento info:backups:list`

>[!WARNING]
>
>This command deletes the specified files or the database before restoring them. For example, the `--media-file` option deletes media assets under the `pub/media` directory before restoring from the specified rollback file. Make sure you have not changed the file system or database that you want to keep before using this command.

>[!NOTE]
>
>To display a list of available backup files, enter `magento info:backups:list`

This command performs the following tasks:

1. Puts the store in maintenance mode.
1. Verifies the backup file name.
1. If you specify a code rollback file:

   a. Verifies that the rollback destination locations are writable (note that the `pub/static` and `var` folders are ignored).

   b. Deletes all files and directories under your application installation directory.

   c. Extracts the archive file to the destination locations.

1. If you specify a database rollback file:

   a. Drops the entire database.

   b. Restores the database using the database backup.

1. If you specify a media rollback file:

   a. Verifies that the rollback destination locations are writable.

   b. Deletes all files and directories under `pub/media`

   c. Extracts the archive file to the destination locations.

1. Takes the store out of maintenance mode.

For example, to restore a code (that is, file system) backup, enter the following commands in the order shown:

*  Display a list of backups:

   ```bash
   magento info:backups:list
   ```

*  Restore a file backup named `1433876616_filesystem.tgz`:

   ```bash
   magento setup:rollback --code-file="1433876616_filesystem.tgz"
   ```

   Messages similar to the following display:

   ```terminal
   Enabling maintenance mode
   Code rollback is starting ...
   Code rollback filename: 1433876616_filesystem.tgz
   Code rollback file path: /var/www/html/magento2/var/backups/1433876616_filesystem.tgz
   [SUCCESS]: Code rollback has completed successfully.
   Disabling maintenance mode
   ```

>[!NOTE]
>
>To run the `magento` command again without changing directories, you might need to enter `cd pwd`.
