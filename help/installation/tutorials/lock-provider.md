# Configure the lock provider

## Configure the lock

Configure a lock provider to prevent the launch of duplicate cron jobs and cron groups. (Requires Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source 2.2.x, 2.2.5 and later, and 2.3.3 and later.)

Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source use the database to save locks by default. If you have multiple nodes on your servers, we recommend using Zookeeper as the lock provider.

If you are running Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure, you do not need to configure lock provider settings. The application configures the file lock provider for Pro projects during the provisioning process. See [Cloud variables](https://devdocs.magento.com/cloud/env/variables-cloud.html).
